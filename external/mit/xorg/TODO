plan:
	- build modular-xorg stuff with reach over

	- everyone gets lib, share and bin

	- initially, only xorg happy platforms get Xserver.  other older
	  platforms with xsrc-based servers will build those.


big items:

libs		- done
			-- many libs may not install manuals yet.
			-- many libs should have pkg-config files generated/installed?
			   this will apparently help with pkgsrc.
			-- libGL has has glapi_x86.S commented out from the
			   build because it spews when eating -traditional-cpp
			   cheap whitespace hacks have been discussed or
			   phone suggested we only pass -traditional-cpp to
			   platforms where assemblers do things with '#'.

tools		- done
share		- done
bin		- done
			-- many apps don't install manuals yet
			-- many apps need app-config generated/installed?
			   this will apparently help with pkgsrc.
Xserver 	- 


things to delete:
- lbx is dead, kill it
