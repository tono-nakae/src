plan:
	- build modular-xorg stuff with reach over

	- everyone gets lib, share and bin

	- initially, only xorg happy platforms get Xserver.  other older
	  platforms with xsrc-based servers will build those.


big items:

libs		- done
			-- many libs may not install manuals yet.
			-- many libs should have pkg-config files generated/installed?
			   this will apparently help with pkgsrc.
tools		- done
share		- done
bin		- done
			-- many apps don't install manuals yet
			-- many apps need app-config generated/installed?
			   this will apparently help with pkgsrc.
Xserver 	- 


things to delete:
- lbx is dead, kill it
