<section id="atf-0-7">

<title>Changes in version 0.7</title>

<para>Experimental version released on December 22nd, 2009.</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Added build-time checks to atf-c and atf-c++.  A binding
for atf-sh will come later.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Migrated all build-time checks for header files to proper
ATF tests.  This demonstrates the use of the new feature described
above.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added an internal API for child process
management.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Converted all plain-text distribution documents to a Docbook
canonical version, and include pre-generated plain text and HTML copies in
the distribution file.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Simplified the contents of the
<filename>Makefile.am</filename> by regenerating it from a canonical
<filename>Makefile.am.m4</filename> source.  As a side-effect, some
dependency specifications were fixed.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Migrated all checks from the <literal>check</literal> target
to <literal>installcheck</literal>, as these require ATF to be
installed.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Fixed sign comparison mismatches triggered by
the now-enabled <literal>-Wsign-compare</literal>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Fixed many memory and object leaks.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<section id="atf-0-6">

<title>Changes in version 0.6</title>

<para>Experimental version released on January 18th, 2009.</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Make atf-exec be able to kill its child process after a
certain period of time; this is controlled through the new -t
option.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Change atf-sh to use atf-exec's -t option to control the
test case's timeouts, instead of doing it internally.  Same behavior as
before, but noticeably faster.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>atf-exec's -g option and atf-killpg are gone due to the
previous change.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added the atf-check(1) tool, a program that executes a
given command and checks its exit code against a known value and allows the
management of stdout and stderr in multiple ways.  This replaces the
previous atf_check function in the atf-sh library and exposes this
functionality to both atf-c and atf-c++.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added the ATF_REQUIRE family of macros to the C interface.
These help in checking for fatal test conditions.  The old ATF_CHECK macros
now perform non-fatal checks only.  I.e. by using ATF_CHECK, the test case
can now continue its execution and the failures will not be reported until
the end of the whole run.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Extended the amount of ATF_CHECK_* C macros with new ones
to provide more features to the developer.  These also have their
corresponding counterparts in the ATF_REQUIRE_* family.  The new macros
(listing the suffixes only) are: _EQ (replaces _EQUAL), _EQ_MSG, _STREQ and
_STREQ_MSG.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</section>

<section id="atf-0-5">

<title>Changes in version 0.5</title>

<para>Experimental version released on May 1st, 2008.</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Clauses 3 and 4 of the BSD license used by the project were
dropped.  All the code is now under a 2-clause BSD license compatible with
the GNU General Public License (GPL).</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added a C-only binding so that binary test programs do not
need to be tied to C++ at all.  This binding is now known as the atf-c
library.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Renamed the C++ binding to atf-c++ for consistency with the
new atf-c.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Renamed the POSIX shell binding to atf-sh for consistency
with the new atf-c and atf-c++.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added a -w flag to test programs through which it is
possible to specify the work directory to be used.  This was possible in
prior releases by defining the workdir configuration variable (-v
workdir=...), but was a conceptually incorrect mechanism.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Test programs now preserve the execution order of test
cases when they are given in the command line.  Even those mentioned more
than once are executed multiple times to comply with the user's
requests.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<section id="atf-0-4">

<title>Changes in version 0.4</title>

<para>Experimental version released on February 4th, 2008.</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Added two new manual pages, atf-c++-api and atf-sh-api,
describing the C++ and POSIX shell interfaces used to write test
programs.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added a pkg-config file, useful to get the flags to build
against the C++ library or to easily detect the presence of
ATF.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added a way for test cases to require a specific
architecture and/or machine type through the new 'require.arch' and
'require.machine' meta-data properties, respectively.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added the 'timeout' property to test cases, useful to set
an upper-bound limit for the test's run time and thus prevent global test
program stalls due to the test case's misbehavior.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added the atf-exec(1) internal utility, used to execute a
command after changing the process group it belongs to.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added the atf-killpg(1) internal utility, used to kill
process groups.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Multiple portability fixes.  Of special interest, full
support for SunOS (Solaris Express Developer Edition 2007/09) using the Sun
Studio 12 C++ compiler.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Fixed a serious bug that prevented atf-run(1) from working
at all under Fedora 8 x86_64.  Due to the nature of the bug, other
platforms were likely affected too.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</section>

<section id="atf-0-3">

<title>Changes in version 0.3</title>

<para>Experimental version released on November 11th, 2007.</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Added XML output support to atf-report.  This is
accompanied by a DTD for the format's structure and sample XSLT/CSS files
to post-process this output and convert it to a plain HTML
report.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Changed atf-run to add system information to the report it
generates.  This is currently used by atf-report's XML output only, and is
later printed in the HTML reports in a nice and useful summary table.  The
user and system administrator are allowed to tune this feature by means of
hooks.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Removed the test cases' 'isolated' property.  This was
intended to avoid touching the file system at all when running the related
test case, but this has not been true for a long while: some control files
are unconditionally required for several purposes, and we cannot easily get
rid of them.  This way we remove several critical and delicate pieces of
code.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Improved atf-report's CSV output format to include
information about test programs too.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Fixed the tests that used atf-compile to not require this
tool as a helper.  Avoids systems without build-time utilities to skip many
tests that could otherwise be run.  (E.g. NetBSD without the comp.tgz set
installed.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Many general cleanups: Fixed many pieces of code marked as
ugly and/or incomplete.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</section>

<section id="atf-0-2">

<title>Changes in version 0.2</title>

<para>Experimental version released on September 20th, 2007.</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Test cases now get a known umask on
entry.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>atf-run now detects many unexpected failures caused by test
programs and reports them as bogus tests.  atf-report is able to handle
these new errors and nicely reports them to the user.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>All the data formats read and written by the tools have
been documented and cleaned up.  These include those grammars that define
how the different components communicate with each other as well as the
format of files written by the developers and users: the Atffiles and the
configuration files.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Added the atf-version tool, a utility that displays
information about the currently installed version of ATF.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Test cases can now define an optional cleanup routine to
undo their actions regardless of their exit status.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>atf-report now summarizes the list of failed (bogus) test
programs when using the ticker output format.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Test programs now capture some termination signals and
clean up any temporary files before exiting the program.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Multiple bug fixes and improvements all
around.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<section id="atf-0-1">

<title>Changes in version 0.1</title>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>First public version.  This was released coinciding with
the end of the Google Summer of Code 2007 program.</para></listitem>
