<h1>
<a name="overview">Overview</a>
</h1>
<p xml:space="preserve">
This document describes the major steps to be taken before getting
to the first stable release of ATF, 1.0.  Some of these steps
describe
the transition from the old code base to the new ideas documented
in the
specification (TODO: Add link somehow).
</p>
<h1>
<a name="plan-0-8">The plan to 0.8</a>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Add atf-sh interface to build-time tests.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Properly document the libraries: i.e. one page per
module, detailed information of each function and type, etc.  At
the
very least atf-c.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Add a tool to collect multiple outputs of atf-run (from
different machines) and generate a single (XML-only?) log with
everything.  Must allow easy conversion to HTML for online
publishing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Allow grouping of test programs in tiers in an Atffile.
This is to permit the user specify "dependencies" between test
programs:
e.g. do not run a specific test program if its dependencies have
failed,
because it will certainly fail also.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Provide a kernel-level unit testing API (for NetBSD
only, at the moment).  This should come in the form of an atf.ko
module
that provides functions to define and register test cases,
functions for
results reporting and an interface (a trivial file system?) that
transports the application/X-atf-tcs output to user-space, provides
information to user-space about the available test cases (a list)
and
allows user-space to launch the execution of test
cases.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a name="plan-0-9">The plan to 0.9</a>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Add a module to atf-c to manage dynamic memory.  Should
provide a "mem chunk" object that can only be managed through
functions
(i.e. not directly) so that access to buffers can be safely
controlled.
Dealing with strdup and similar functions, for example, might be
complex.
</p>
<p xml:space="preserve">
See these old revisions for a start, but these did not work
correctly because the use of (void **) casts brought aliasing
problems:

<a name="plan-pre-1-0">The plan to 1.0 prereleases</a>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Fix all occurrences of XXX, TODO and
FIXME.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Split the distfile into multiple components.  We should
have a component for each language binding and a component
providing the
ATF tools, at the very least.  If we had this, external programs
using
ATF wouldn't need to depend on the tools and/or the C++ binding,
because
they could just require the user to build the atf-c
binding.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Think of a way to properly add tests for (almost?) all
error paths.  Most of them are probably broken
already.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Improve error reporting: aside from clarifying error
messages, this also implies adding more error cases to give them
more
semantic meaning at the source code level..
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Make the shell library work with 'set
-e'?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Shell test programs dynamically locate where the shell
library is by calling atf-config (done by atf.init.subr). 
Contrarywise,
binary test programs are directly linked against the final location
of
libatf.  It may be nice if the latter loaded the library
dynamically
based on what atf-config said, so the user could switch atf
installations by simply changing its PATH (and effectively making
atf
relocatable on the file system).  Why could this be nice?  To
painlessly
run an older atf test suite against a more recent version of the
code
base to ensure there are no regressions even with older tests. 
Just a
crazy idea, as maybe what the shell test programs currently do is
stupid.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Allow users to customize the build of atf by defining
additional meta-data for test cases.  At the moment this is
possible
because the meta-data is not sanity-checked, but I think it should
be.
Following the previous item, NetBSD could add a 'netbsd.pr'
variable and
then use this data when generating reports to add direct links to
the
appropriate PRs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Make sure that the tests in tests/atf have, at the very
least, the same coverage as the ones in
tests/bootstrap.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Document the code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Possibly add a way to automatically gain or drop
privileges when require.user is set.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p xml:space="preserve">
Add a way to specify which bug/issue/whatever a given
test case is stress-testing.  This information is useful when
detecting
regressions.

</li>

<a name="plan-1.0-rc">The plan to 1.0 release candidates</a>

<p xml:space="preserve">
Build libatf as a shared library and set -version-info
accordingly.

Set the DTDs' versions to 1.0.

<p xml:space="preserve">
Allow the parallel execution of tests.  Achieving this
with a test program granularity is easy: only need to change
atf-run.
Lowering it to a finer granularity (test cases) is harder and maybe
not
worth it.
