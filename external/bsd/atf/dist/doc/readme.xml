<title>Introduction</title>

<para>The Automated Testing Framework (ATF) is a collection of libraries
and utilities designed to ease unattended application testing in the hands
of developers and end users of a specific piece of software.</para>

<para>As regards developers, ATF provides the necessary means to easily
create test suites composed of multiple test programs, which in turn are a
collection of test cases.  It also attempts to simplify the debugging of
problems when these test cases detect an error by providing as much
information as possible about the failure.</para>

<para>As regards users, it simplifies the process of running the test
suites and, in special, encourages end users to run them often: they do not
need to have source trees around nor any other development tools installed
to be able to certify that a given piece of software works on their machine
as advertised.</para>
