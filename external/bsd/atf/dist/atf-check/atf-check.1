exit code, stdout and stderr.
.Pp
In the first synopsis form,
.Nm
will execute the provided command and apply checks specified
by arguments.
By default it will act as if it was run with
.Fl s
.Ar eq:0
.Fl o
.Ar empty
.Fl e
.Ar empty
.Pp
In the second synopsis form,
.Nm
will print information about all supported options and their purpose.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag  -width XqualXvalueXX
.It Fl h
Shows a short summary of all available options and their purpose.
.It Fl s Ar qual:value
Analyzes exit code.
Must be one of:
.Bl -tag -width eq:<value> -compact
.It Ar ignore
ignores exit status
.It Ar eq:<value>
checks that exit status is equal to value
.It Ar ne:<value>
checks that exit status is other than value
.El
.It Fl o Ar action:arg
Analyzes standard output.
Must be one of:
.Bl -tag -width inline:<value> -compact
.It Ar empty
checks that stdout is empty
.It Ar ignore
ignores stdout
.It Ar file:<path>
compares stdout with given file
.It Ar inline:<value>
compares stdout with inline value
.It Ar save:<path>

Analyzes standard error (syntax identical to above)
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits 0 on success, and other (unspecified) value on failure.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Exit code 0, nothing on stdout/stderr
atf-check 'true' || atf_fail

# Typical usage if failure is expected
atf-check -s ne:0 'false' || atf_fail

# Checking stdout/stderr
echo foobar >expout
atf-check -o file:expout -e inline:"xx\etyy\en" \e
    'echo foobar ; printf "xx\etyy\en" >&2' || atf_fail
