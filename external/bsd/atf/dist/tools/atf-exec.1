.Sh NAME
.Nm atf-exec
.Nd executes a command in a controlled manner
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl t Ar secs:file
.Ar command
.Nm
.Fl h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a wrapper that executes a given command in a controlled manner.
At the moment, all it can do is set a timeout on the command and
terminate it (and all of its children) if the timeout expires.
.Pp
In the first synopsis form,
.Nm
will execute the provided command and, unless any options are specified,
the command is executed as if
.Nm
had not been used.
If the
.Fl t
option is used,
.Nm
will forcibly terminate the command if a specified amount of time passes.
The subprocesses are run on a different process group, so that the
termination of the parent also causes the termination of all of its
children.
.Pp
In the second synopsis form,
.Nm
will print information about all supported options and their purpose.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width XtXsecsXfileXX
.It Fl h
Shows a short summary of all available options and their purpose.
.It Fl t Ar secs:file
Kills the child process after
.Ar secs
seconds unless it has voluntarily finished before this amount of time
has passed.
If the time runs out, the control file
.Ar file
is created and an error code is returned.
