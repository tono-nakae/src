To update tmux to a new version:

- Use prepare-import.sh to regenerate the dist directory.
- Use configure from the distfile to generate new config.{h,mk} files.
- Copy the generated config.h to usr.bin/tmux.
- Update usr.bin/tmux/Makefile according to config.mk (in particular, the
  list of files used from compat/ and the required libraries).

  dist/*.c listing.
- cvs import the contents of the new dist directory.
- Commit the changes to the reachover Makefiles.
