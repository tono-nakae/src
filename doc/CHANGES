	i386: add support for Microsoft Xbox. [jmcneill 20070105]
	ntp: Import ntp 4.2.4 (20061228). Tracking of network interface address
		changes is now supported - no more ntpd restarts when interface
		addresses are re-configured (WLAN/DSL/ppp/...). [kardel 20070106]
	ug(4): driver for the Abit uGuru hardware system monitor,
		contributed by Mihai Chelaru. [xtraeme 20070106]
	kernel: global 'securelevel' variable removed; it is now internal to
		the secmodel. [elad 20070110]
	GCC: Updated to version 4.1.2-20070110.  [mrg 20070111]
	acpitools: added from FreeBSD via fvdl [christos 20070114]
	scsictl(8): added setspeed command, to set the highest speed that the
		optical drive should use for reading data,
		contributed by Kimura Fuyuki. [bouyer 20070122]
	i386, amd64: remove option COMPAT_386BSD_MBRPART from default
		kernels.  NetBSD has not used partition ID 0x165 for many,
		many years, and the presence of this option in INSTALL
		kernels can cause overwriting of existing FreeBSD
		installations when sysinst writes back the disklabel.
		Those with very, very old NetBSD installations may find
		that they must update their fdisk partition tables to use
		partition ID 0x169 for their NetBSD partitions.
