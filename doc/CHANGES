Changes from NetBSD 4.0 to NetBSD 5.0:
	iwi(4): Use firmload(9) to load firmware images. You no longer need to
		use iwictl(8) to load the firmware. [skrll 20060809]
	acorn32: Remove the old, pre-wscons, console code.  Kernel
		configurations using the old console (kbd, vt, and vidcconsole)
		will need to be updated to use wscons. [bjh21 20060814]
	wpi(4): Driver for Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG.  OpenBSD wpi driver
		ported by Jean-Baptiste Campesato. [simonb 20060818]
	acorn32: Correctly detect the display refresh rate being used under
		RISC OS and look for a matching mode in a list of standard
		video modes.  This removes the requirement for compiling

	netns: Support for XNS in the kernel and userspace has been
		removed. [matt 20060825]
