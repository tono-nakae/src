NetBSD Networking Roadmap
=========================

This is a small roadmap document, and deals with the networking
side of the operating system.

The following projects are expected to be included in NetBSD 6.0

1. Mobile IPv6
2. SCTP
3. network driver polling
4. ALTQ processing on input
5. integrated multicast dns / zeroconf
6. tcp support in libsa
7. netboot from http

We currently expect to branch 6.0 in the March 2010 timeframe, with a view
to a 6.0 release later in 2010.

We'll continue to update this roadmap as features and dates get firmed up.
