NetBSD Virtualization Roadmap
=============================

This is a small roadmap document, and deals with the virtualization
side of the operating system.

1. NetBSD/usermode
2. virtualization jails via secmodel
3. iSCSI booting
4. iSCSI device cloning
5. Xen domU migration, suspend and resume
6. Xen balloon driver support

We currently expect to branch 6.0 in the March 2010 timeframe, with a view
to a 6.0 release later in 2010.

We'll continue to update this roadmap as features and dates get firmed up.


Some explanations
=================

1. NetBSD/usermode
------------------

NetBSD/usermode is an port of NetBSD to a POSIX-compatible user-space,
with the intention that it should be possible to run the usermode
version of NetBSD on any POSIX-compatible operating system.  This code
has been committed to the repository, but more work is needed.

Responsible: jmcneill

2. Virtualization Jails via secmodel
------------------------------------

One novel way of creating jails for virtualization is to use a new
secmodel (part of the kauth framework), to isolate processes into
jail-based virtual machines. This is the basis of a paper given by
bad@ at AsiaBSDcon in March 2008.

Responsible: bad

3. iSCSI booting
----------------

In order to make Xen domains migration-friendly, the storage that the
domain uses must be based on some form of network-centric storage, either
NFS, or a SAN or IP-SAN. For IP-SANs, iSCSI booting will be used. This
is dependent on the in-kernel iSCSI initiator project completing.

Responsible: agc

4. iSCSI device cloning
-----------------------

To minimise the storage requirements for multiple domU booting, using
a standard root filesystem or block device for the domU is required, along
with some form of copy-on-write mechanism to preserve any modifications
that are made.

Responsible: agc

5. Xen domU migration, suspend and resume
-----------------------------------------

Xen domU migration is where a domU domain is moved from one dom0 to
another dom0 on the same vlan (to avoid networking problems, the
virtual arp address migrates with the domU itself). jym is actively
working on this, and preliminary results are good.

Responsible: jym, bouyer

6. Xen balloon driver support
-----------------------------

The balloon driver allows more memory to be added to a running Xen domU
instance; this allows extra memory to be used by the domU for resource
peak needs. cherry has made a preliminary balloon driver - some testing
is needed before it can be committed.

Responsible: cherry
