#	$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.1 2002/09/21 08:17:40 lukem Exp $

THINGS TO BE DONE:

[ Note that this list does not include change requests filed via 'gnats'.
  For information about them, mail query-pr@NetBSD.org. ]

This is a list of things that need to be done for NetBSD.  Some of
these projects are small, others are large.  Some are extremely
important, others are enhancements to make the system more flexible
for the wide variety of NetBSD users and their applications.

In general there are some guidelines for work to be included in
NetBSD.  Chief among these are:

	   (1) Keep GPLed stuff out of the kernel.
	   (2) Introduce little to no more GPLed stuff as non-optional
	       components of the user environment.
	   (3) Only clean code, that lends itself to further enhancement
	   (4) Keep architecture dependent code out of architecture independent
	       directories

Associated with some entries are login names which indicate persons or
groups who may already be working on that problem.  This isn't to say
that others shouldn't also look at it, but consultation with other
parties may result in less duplicated work.  A directory of these
persons can be found after the todo list itself.

Please don't hesitate to suggest more projects for this list.
Suggestions, comments, etc to projects@NetBSD.org.

High Kernel:
    swap fixes:
	swap to file of dynamic size; see apollo
    nfs:
	kernel suport for lockd(8), lockf(3)
    clean up support for LKM and protections checking (cgd)

Low Kernel:
    [hp300] integrate into new SCSI setup (or wait for torek's?)

User-level support:
    replace routed with gated (trouble with gated license).
    
User programs:
    rwall nfs-mountees on shutdown
    add detachment to window
    clean up gas config files, set up common defines
    fix things that use $EDITOR to use system() or friends
        rather than exec(), because some people put options in
        $EDITOR (some programs do this correctly already)

Pie-in-the-Sky:
    someone should actually test all the netiso stuff.	
    SMB filesystem

Documentation:
    modify sys docs to reflect NetBSD/arch-specific stuff
    clean up src/share/man/{man0,tools} so that we can generate a printable
        version from the manpages again.

i386 kernel support:
     better ways of accessing BIOS, i/o space.  some exportable to
	user space.  See mach3,linux dos emulator
