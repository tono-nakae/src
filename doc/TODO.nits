# This file documents small nits in our code (often marked in comments
# with /* XXX */) and similar "small fixes needed" so that they will not
# be forgotten.
# 
# Generally speaking, this file represents a queue of small,
# straightforward things to fix. If something is a serious project, it
# should probably go in to TODO. If it is unlikely something will ever
# be fixed, do not put it in this file, just document it in a comment.
# 
# The entry format is:
# 
#   YYYY-MM-DD (userid) Explanation
# 
# The date is the date the nit was first added.
#
# Try to keep the format consistent -- we may want to machine parse it
# someday.
# 
# Add new nits at the bottom of the file. Remove old nits as you fix
# them.

2005-09-10 (christos) Convert src/lib/libc/rpc to use kqueues, the way
    FreeBSD does.
2005-09-13 (christos) src/lib/libpthread depends on __LIBC12_SOURCE__
    and compat headers. This is unnecessary.
