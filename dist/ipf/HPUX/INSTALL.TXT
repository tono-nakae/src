Installation instructions:
========================= 

1. Update HP-UX Kernel
----------------------
The first step is to update your /usr/conf/lib/libnet.a used for building
kernels.  As yet (8th June 2000), there is not an official HP patch that
addresses this.  In the mean time, the required files can be downloaded
from:

http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/stcpmap.tgz

If you unpack this archive, the directory "stcpmap" will have the
appropriate files in it.  Run the "install" script from that directory.

WARNING: It will build and install a new kernel.

After this, you *MUST* reboot so that the new kernel is in place when
you proceed to install later components.

2. Build and Install pfil
-------------------------
Next, you need to download and install "pfil".  This is a STREAMS interface
for packet filtering that removes the need for packet filtering code to be
written as a STREAMS module.  This can be downloaded from

http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/pfil.tar.gz

Unpack this and type "make" in the pfil directory.  Once compelte, type
"make install" to kick off the installation.

3. Build and Install IP Filter
------------------------------
Having got this far, you now need to download the latest IP Filter package
and compile/install that.  The source code for IP Filter can be obtained
from:
http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/ip_fil4.0alpha6.tar.gz
This should be unpacked into the same directory as "pfil" is.  The
directory layout will look like this:

/directory/ip_fil4.0alpha6
/directory/pfil

This complete, do a "make hpux" in the ip_fil4.0alpha6 directory, followed
by a "make install".  You will need to reboot for it to become active.
