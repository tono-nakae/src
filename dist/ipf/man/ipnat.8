.SH NAME
ipnat \- user interface to the NAT
.SH SYNOPSIS
.Nm ipnat
.B ipnat
[
.B \-lnrsvCF
]
.B \-f <\fIfilename\fP>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBipnat\fP opens the filename given (treating "\-" as stdin) and parses the
file for a set of rules which are to be added or removed from the IP NAT.
.PP
Each rule processed by \fBipnat\fP
is added to the kernels internal lists if there are no parsing problems.
Rules are added to the end of the internal lists, matching the order in
which they appear when given to \fBipnat\fP.
.PP
\fBPlease Note\fP
that
\fBipnat\fP
is not functional without
\fBipf(8)\fP
running. In addition, the following kernel options need to be turned on
in order to use
\fBipnat\fP:
\fIIPFORWARDING\fP
and
\fIPFIL_HOOKS\fP.
The
\fIGATEWAY\fP
kernel option includes the
\fIIPFORWARDING\fP
option.
The sysctl command:
.LP
.nf
        sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding
.fi     
.PP     
will inform you if
\fIIPFORWARDING\fP
is currently turned on in your kernel.
Please see
\fBoptions(4)\fP
and
\fBsysctl(8)\fP
for more information on turning these parameters on.
