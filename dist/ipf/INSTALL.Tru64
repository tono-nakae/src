Versions of Tru64 (aka OSF1) earlier than 5.1 aren't supported since
the relevant interfaces don't exist.  Tru64 5.1 and 5.1a have been
tested.

        1. do a "make tru64" (or "make osf") in this directory

        2. change directory to OSF and run "make install"

To enable IPFilter, you then need to do:
sysconfig -c ipfilter

Tru64 checkpoints:
- enable ipforwarding and ipgateway with "iprsetup -s"
