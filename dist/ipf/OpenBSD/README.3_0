Installing IPFilter into OpenBSD 3.0 Kernel
===========================================
The installation of IPFilter should be as easy as following the steps
below.  In cases where "i386" is mentioned, if you are working on a
different platform, substitute that name there and it should work equally
as well.  The patches include enabling IPFilter for IPv4 filtering, IPv6
filtering and bridge filtering.

The commands given below are intended as guides rather than exact matches
on what needs to be typed.  In many cases, paths to files or directories
may bear little resemblence to what is presented below.

You may encounter difficulties with step 7 if you have made changes to the
rc files which cause "patch" to not be able to work out how to apply the
changes correctly.

If the below steps are followed with no problems then it should be safe to
perform step 8 and reboot with the new kernel.  Of course if you are not
using GENERIC then substitute GENERIC for your kernel name.  If your kernel
config file includes the "GENERIC" one then you will not need to add explicit
options for IPFilter.

1. Extract your source tree into /usr/src, creating /usr/src/sys.

cd /usr/src
gunzip -c sys.tar.gz | tar xpf -

2. Change directory to /usr/src

3. Unpack IPFilter and apply the patches to the kernel source 

cd ~
gunzip -c ip_fil3.4.23.tar.gz | tar xpf -
cd /usr/src
patch < ~/ip_fil3.4.23/OpenBSD/3.0-sys-diffs

4. Add IPFilter to the source code tree:

cd ~/ip_fil3.4.23
BSD/kupgrade

5. Build a new OpenBSD kernel

/bin/rm -rf /sys/arch/i386/compile/GENERIC
cd /sys/arch/i386/conf
config GENERIC
cd ../compile/GENERIC
make depend && make
cp bsd /bsd

6. Build and install IPFilter

cd ip_fil3.4.23
make openbsd
make install-bsd
OpenBSD/makedevs-3.0

7. Patch rc scripts in /etc

cd /etc
patch < ~/ip_fil3.4.23/OpenBSD/3.0-rc-diffs

8. Reboot


IPFilter device files
=====================
Patches to include making IPFilter devices can be found in the file
3.0-MAKEDEV-diffs.  These diffs are generally only of interested if
you are going to be building a distribution for others and want the
correct MAKEDEV scripts to be built.  You may also wish to use this
to patch /dev/MAKEDEV on your machine to be correct.  Pre-fab'd MAKEDEV
scripts (or individual patches) for each architecture are not provided.
You will need to have extracted "./etc" from src.tar.gz to use these
patches.
