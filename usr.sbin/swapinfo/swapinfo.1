.Sh NAME
.Nm swapinfo
.Nd display free swap space
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm swapinfo
.Op Fl kmn
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Swapinfo
displays statistics about the amount of free swap space on all of the 
swap areas compiled into the kernel.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl k
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
The
.Fl k
option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
.It Fl m
Show the contents of the system swap map.
.It Fl n
Do not print swap device statistics.
.It Fl M
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the default
.Dq Pa /dev/kmem .
.It Fl N
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the default
.Dq Pa /netbsd .
.El
.Sh STATISTICS
Statistics are reported for all swap partitions configured into the kernel.
The first column is the device name of the partition.  The next column is
the total space available in the partition.  The 
.Ar Used
column indicates the total blocks used so far;  the 
.Ar Avail
column indicates how much space is remaining on each partition.
The
.Ar Capacity
reports the percentage of space used.
.Pp
If more than one partition is configured into the system, totals for all
of the statistics will be reported in the final line of the report.
.Pp
When printing the contents of the system swap map,
.Nm swapinfo
prints the number of swap map entries as well as information for each
entry which is currently in use.  The swap map entry number is reported
in the
.Ar Entry
column.  The
.Ar Size
column is the size of that block in the swap map, and the
.Ar Start
and
.Ar End
columns are the start and end of the entry, respectively.  All values
are printed in units of blocks.
.Sh ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environmental variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl k
option is not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of that
size block.
.Sh "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
Statistics are reported for all swap partitions compiled into the kernel,
regardless of whether those partitions are being used.
