       bboooottpptteesstt  sends  BOOTP  requests to the host specified as
       _s_e_r_v_e_r_-_n_a_m_e  at  one-second  intervals  until   either   a
       response  is  received,  or  until  ten requests have gone
       unanswered.  After a response is received, bboooottpptteesstt  will
       wait one more second listening for additional responses.

       --hh     Use the hardware (Ethernet) address to identify the
              client.  By default, the IP address is copied  into
              the  request  indicating  that  this client already
              knows its IP address.

       A _t_e_m_p_l_a_t_e_-_f_i_l_e may be specified, in which case  bboooottpptteesstt
       uses  the (binary) contents of this file to initialize the
       _o_p_t_i_o_n_s area of the request packet.

       The bootptest program is a  combination  of  original  and
       derived  works.   The main program module (bootptest.c) is
       original work by Gordon W. Ross <gwr@mc.com>.  The  packet
       printing  module  (print-bootp.c)  is  a slightly modified
       version of a file from the BSD tcpdump program.

       This program includes software developed by the University
       of  California,  Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and its con-
       tributors.  (See the copyright notice in print-bootp.c)
