.Sh NAME
.Nm btuartd
.Nd Bluetooth HCI UART (H4) daemon.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl c Ar conffile
.Nm
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl i Ar init_speed
.Op Ar type
.Ar comdev speed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
daemon configure and attach Bluetooth HCI UART devices.  It opens
.Ar comdev
like
.Xr com 4
and compatible devices, also configure
.Ar speed
and flow.  The
.Nm
daemon support HCI UART.  The former is read the configuration file.  And
working on the daemon mode.  The latter sets the device given by the
argument. 
.Pp
When the SIGHUP is received in the daemon mode, all devices are closed.
And, it works reading the configuration file again. 
.Pp
If the
.Ar type
is given, then
.Nm
set
.Ar type
to
.Xr btuart 4 .
The
.Ar type
supports:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXX
.It Cm ericsson
Ericsson based modules
.It Cm digi
Digianswer based cards
.It Cm texas
Texas Instruments
.It Cm csr
Cambridge Silicon Radio Casira serial adapter or BrainBoxes serial dongle
(BL642)
.It Cm swave
Silicon Wave kits
.It Cm st
ST Microelectronics minikits based on STLC2410/STLC2415
.It Cm stlc2500
ST Microelectronics minikits based on STLC2500
.It Cm bt2000c
AmbiCom BT2000C Bluetooth PC/CF Card
.It Cm bcm2035
Broadcom BCM2035
.It Cm *
Unspecified HCI UART interface
.El
.Pp
The command line options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fl c Ar conffile
Specify the configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/bluetooth/btuartd.conf .
.It Fl d
Run in foreground (do not detach).
.It Fl f
Enable flow control as
.Xr com 4 .
.It Fl i Ar init_speed
Specify the initial speed for Bluetooth module.
