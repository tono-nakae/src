 * This is slightly messy / abusatory structure.  It is used for multiple
 * things.  Typical life cycle: create output buffer, append to output
 * queue (pcc included) .  Once the buffer has been sent, the buffer is
 * freed and the structure is appended to reqqueue as psreq.  It is kept
 * there until matching network data is read.  Once this happens, the
 * data from the received buffer is copied to buffer stored on the queue.
 * This should be rewritten, clearly.
 *
 * Also, this should not be copypasted from psshfs.  But that's
 * another matter ;)
