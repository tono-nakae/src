.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_psshfs
.Nd mount a puffs file system using ssh sftp
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Ar user@host[:path]
.Ar mount_point
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to mount a file system using the ssh sftp
subprotocol, making a remote directory hierarchy appear in the
local directory tree.
.Pp
The mandatory parameters are the target host name and local mount
point.
The target host parameter can optionally contain a username whose
credentials will be used by the remote sshd, and a relative or
absolute path for the remote mountpoint's root.
If no user is given, the credentials of the user issuing the mount
command are used.
If no path is given, the user's home directory on the remote machine
will be used.
.Pp
The
.Fl o
flag can be used to give standard mount options and options to puffs.
The most notable of these is
.Fl o Ar nocache ,
which disables the name cache and page cache for the file system.
It slows operations down, but will behave better when multiple
entities are accessing the same directory tree via various routes.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sftp 1 ,
.Xr puffs 3 ,
.Xr puffs 4 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr sshd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 5.0 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Permissions are not handled.
Do not expect the file system to behave except for a single user.
.Pp
The implementation does not currently behave if the file system is
being accessed from other locations besides through the mounting
host.
Mount the file system without caching if the usage pattern is going
to be such.
