.Nd configure virtual terminals on a wscons display
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f Ar <ctldev>
.Op Fl d Op Fl F
.Op Fl t Ar <type>
.Op Fl e Ar <emul>
.Ar index
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
tool allows to create and delete virtual terminals on display devices
controlled by the wscons terminal framework if the underlying display hardware
driver supports multiple screens.
The
.Ar index
argument specifies which virtual terminal is to be configured; the allowed
numbers are from 0 to an implementation-specified value (currently 7, allowing
for 8 virtual terminals on a display).
Without further option arguments, a virtual terminal is created with
implementation specific properties and a default terminal emulation variant
selected at kernel compile time.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxx
.It Fl f Ar ctldev
Specify the control device of the wscons display to operate on.
Default is
.Pa /dev/ttyEcfg .
.It Fl d
Delete the specified terminal. A terminal opened by a program will not be
deleted unless the
.Fl F
option is applied. Terminals used by the operating system console or a
graphics program (X server) cannot be deleted.
.It Fl F
Force deleting of a terminal even if it is in use by a user space program.
.It Fl t Ar type
Specify a screen type to use. Screen types refer to display format, colour
depth and other low-level display properties. Valid
.Ar type
arguments are defined by the underlying display device driver.
.It Fl e Ar emul
Specify the terminal emulation to use for the virtual terminal. The set of
available terminal emulations is determined at kernel compile time.
