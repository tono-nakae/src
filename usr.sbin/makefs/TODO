$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.4 2002/01/23 02:14:19 lukem Exp $

todo
----

- finish makefs.8

- testing

- even more testing

- add support for converting a tar file (instead of a directory tree);
  suggested by kpneal@pobox.com

- reading user/group database from a different source


outstanding bugs
----------------

- size estimation is still out (need to take into account indirect blocks!)

- mkfs.c parameter checking when density is rather high or low (dumps core)
  e.g, a large directory with a small number of files dumps core with a
  floating exception i.e, density is too high such as 21886635 or too
  low such as 30.
  update: lukem, 2001/01/23.  not sure if this is still an issue.


discuss
-------

- consider replacing ffs_balloc() et al with own code that doesn't
  need hacked-up buf.c code

- whacking on newfs/mkfs.c to allow .PATH-ing directly into makefs(8).
  this would involve passing all of mkfs()'s parameters in a single
  struct rather than a lot of global vars, etc.
