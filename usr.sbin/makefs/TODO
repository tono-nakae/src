$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.3 2001/10/29 05:18:25 lukem Exp $

todo
----

- finish makefs.8

- testing

- even more testing

- add support for converting a tar file (instead of a directory tree);
  suggested by kpneal@pobox.com


outstanding bugs
----------------

- size estimation is still out (need to take into account indirect blocks!)

- mkfs.c parameter checking when density is rather high or low (dumps core)
  e.g, a large directory with a small number of files dumps core with a
  floating exception i.e, density is too high such as 21886635 or too
  low such as 30


discuss
-------

- consider replacing ffs_balloc() et al with own code that doesn't
  need hacked-up buf.c code
