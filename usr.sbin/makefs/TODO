$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.1.1.1 2001/10/26 07:41:07 lukem Exp $

todo:

- finish makefs.8

- testing

- even more testing


outstanding bugs:

- size estimation is still out (need to take into account indirect blocks!)

- mkfs.c parameter checking when density is rather high or low (dumps core)
  e.g, a large directory with a small number of files dumps core with a
  floating exception i.e, density is too high such as 21886635 or too
  low such as 30


discuss:

- consider replacing ffs_balloc() et al with own code that doesn't
  need hacked-up buf.c code
