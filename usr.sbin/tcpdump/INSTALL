If you have not built libpcap, do so first.  See the README
file in this directory for the ftp location.

After libpcap has been built (either install it or make sure it's
in ../libpcap), edit the BINDEST and MANDEST paths in Makefile.in
and run ./configure (a shell script).  "configure" will determine
your system attributes and generate an appropriate Makefile from
Makefile.in.  Now build tcpdump by running "make".  (If you're system
is not listed in the README as one which we have tested, you may have
to modify the configure script and Makefile.in.  Please send us patches
for any modifications you need to make.)

If everything builds ok, su and type "make install".  This will install
tcpdump and the manual entry.  Note that since the system's packet
capture facility can only be used by root, tcpdump is installed setuid
to root.  As a security measure, we install it executable only by group
"wheel".  On the other hand, BPF packet access is controlled by permissions
to /dev/bpf0 etc., and in this case, tcpdump does not have to be setuid.
In any case, DO NOT give untrusted users the capability of running tcpdump.
Tcpdump can capture any traffic on your net, including passwords.

Note that tcpdump is shipped with some systems, for example, DEC/OSF
and BSD/386.  Remember to remove or rename the installed binary
when upgrading.
