.Sh NAME
.Nm perfused
.Nd "PUFFS Enabled Relay to FUSE Daemon"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl d Ar types
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl i fd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a userland daemon mplementing the FUSE kernel level API. It creates a
.Pa /dev/fuse
socket for FUSE filesystem daemons to conenct to.
.Nm
takes care of mouting the filesystem using 
.Xr puffs 3 .
.Pp
When the kernel sends a 
.Xr puffs 3
operation for the mounted filesystem, 
.Nm
will translate it into a FUSE request, and will send it to the filesystem
daemon through
.Pa /dev/fuse .
The FUSE reply will be converted back into a 
.Xr puffs 3
reply and will be relayed to the kernel.
.Pp
FUSE filesystems daemons must be modified so that they request
.Nm
for performing the 
.Xr mount 2
system call instead of doing it on their own. This is done by 
replacing in the sources
.Xr mount 2
and the
.Xr open 2 
call for
.Pa /dev/fuse
by
.Fn perfuse_mount
and 
.Fn perfuse_open .
.Xr libperfuse 3
must be used at link time.
Most FUSE filesystem daemons use
.Nm libfuse
and will work unmodified, provided 
the modification is done in 
.Nm libfuse
itself .
.Pp
The following options are availlable:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Do not fork and stay in the foreground.
.It Fl d Ar types
Print additionnal debug information. 
.Ar types
is a comma-separated list of informaton type to print: 
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar puffs
Display PUFFS requests and replies
.It Ar fuse
Display FUSE requests and replies
.It Ar dump
Dump content of FUSE frames
.It Ar fh
Display filehandles activity
.It Ar reclaim
Display reclaim activity
.It Ar readdir
Display readdir activity
.It Ar requeue
Display requeue activity
.It Ar sync
Display dirty flags and sync operations
.El
.It Fl s
Enable debug output only when receiving SIGINFO.
.It Fl i Ar fd
Do not open
.Pa /dev/fuse
but use the socket available from file descriptor
.Ar fd .
This is used when 
.Nm 
is started from 
.Xr libperfuse 3 .
.El
.Sh ERRORS
The program logs to the syslog daemon as facility
.Dq daemon .
For detailed debugging use the
.Fl d 
(debug) option.
