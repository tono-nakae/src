} Here is my new fight in Bind 4.9.3 B17 installation :

} ns2 is the name of the machine.
} loghost is well defined in the /etc/hosts file but it looks like this file wasn't

} Is there a way to specify that the hosts file has to be read or does loghost must be

With this resolver, there is no way to reference /etc/hosts.  You can either
put loghost in the DNS database, or another possibility is to do what I've
done here.  I changed the invokation of syslogd in /etc/rc.local to:

	HOSTALIASES=/etc/hostaliases syslogd

and I created the file /etc/hostaliases and put the following in it:

loghost localhost.gv.ssi1.com

You'll have to modify this with your local domain.  If you use localhost
instead of a central log host, you'll need the localhost entry in DNS.
