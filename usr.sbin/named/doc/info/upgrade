	From this message I would assume that the following events
	occured.

	This is the first installation of 4.9{.X} on this machine.
	The old cache files were NOT removed prior to starting the new
	nameserver.

	What has happened here in the glue A records in the old cache
	files were read into the internal cache with a higher clev than
	the real A records. A zone transfer then occured for the zone
	from which they were loaded and the A records were `lost'.

	4.9.2 depends on the cache files having been made with a 4.9.2
	named-xfer.

	Mark.
