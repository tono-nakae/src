.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility installs and removes
.Nx
disk bootstrap software into a file system.
.Nm
can install
.Ar bootstrap
into
.Ar filesystem ,
or disable an existing bootstrap in
.Ar filesystem .
.Pp
Generally,
.Nx
disk bootstrap software consists of two parts: a
.Dq primary
bootstrap program usually written into the disklabel area of the
file system by
.Nm "" ,
and a
.Dq secondary
bootstrap program that usually resides as an ordinary file in the file system.
.Pp
When booting, the primary bootstrap program is loaded and invoked by
the machine's PROM or BIOS.
After receiving control of the system it loads and runs the secondary
bootstrap program, which in turn loads and runs the kernel.
The secondary bootstrap may allow control over various boot parameters
passed to the kernel.
.Pp
Perform the following steps to make a file system bootable:
.Bl -enum
.It
Copy the secondary bootstrap (usually
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot. Ns Sy MACHINE )
to the root directory of the target file system.
.Pp
.Nx Ns Tn /pmax
requires that this file system starts at block 0 of the disk.
.Pp
The secondary
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc64
bootstrap is located in
.Pa /usr/mdec/ofwboot .
.
.It
Use
.Nm
to install the primary bootstrap program
(usually
.Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx. Ns Sy <fs> )
into
.Ar filesystem .
.Pp
.Nx Ns Tn /pmax
and
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc64
do not require this step if the primary bootstrap already exists
and the secondary bootstrap file is just being updated.
.Pp
The primary
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc64
bootstrap is located in
.Pa /usr/mdec/bootblk .
.El
.Pp
The options recognized by
.Nm
are as follows:
.
.Bl -tag -width "foobar"
.
.It Fl b Ar bno
Install
.Ar bootstrap
at block number
.Ar bno
instead of the default location for the machine and file system type.
.
.It Fl c
Clear (remove) any existing bootstrap instead of installing one.
.
.It Fl m Ar machine
Use
.Ar machine
as the target machine type.
The default machine is determined from
.Xr uname 3
and then
.Ev MACHINE .
The following machines are currently supported by
.Nm "" :
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Sy alpha ,
.Sy pmax ,
.Sy sparc64 ,
.Sy vax
.Ed
.
.
.It Fl n
Do not write to
.Ar filesystem .
.
.It Fl o Ar options
Machine specific
.Nm
options, comma separated.
.Pp
Supported options are (with the machines for they are valid in brackets):
.
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width alphasum
.
.It Sy alphasum
.Em [ alpha ]
Recalculate and restore the Alpha checksum.
This is the default for
.Nx Ns Tn /alpha .
.
.It Sy append
.Em [ pmax ,
.Em vax ]
Append
.Ar bootstrap
to the end of
.Ar filesystem ,
which must be a regular file in this case.
.
.It Sy sunsum
.Em [ pmax ,
.Em vax ]
Recalculate and restore the Sun and
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc
compatible checksum.
.Em Note :
The existing
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc
disklabel should use no more than 4 partitions.
.El
.
.It Fl t Ar fstype
Use
.Ar fstype
as the type of
.Ar filesystem .
The default operation is to attempt to auto-detect this setting.
.
.It Fl v
Verbose operation.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
exits 0 on success, and \*[Gt]0 if an error occurs.
.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Nm
uses the following environment variables:
.
.Bl -tag -width "MACHINE"
.
.It Ev MACHINE
Default value for
.Ar machine ,
overriding the result from
.Xr uname 3 .
.
.El
.
.Sh FILES
Most NetBSD ports will contain variations of the following files:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width /usr/mdec/boot.$MACHINE
.
.It Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx_ Ns Sy <fs>
Primary bootstrap for file system
.Sy <fs> .
Installed into the bootstrap area of the file system by
.Nm "" .
.
.It Pa /usr/mdec/boot. Ns Sy MACHINE
Secondary bootstrap for machine type
.Sy MACHINE .
This should be installed into the file system before
.Nm
is run.
.
.It Pa /boot. Ns Sy MACHINE
Installed copy of secondary bootstrap for machine type
.Sy MACHINE .
.
.It Pa /boot
Installed copy of secondary bootstrap.
Searched for by the primary bootstrap if
.Pa /boot. Ns Sy MACHINE
is not found.
.
.El
.Pp
.Ss NetBSD/sparc64 files
.
.Bl -tag -width /usr/mdec/boot.$MACHINE
.
.It Pa /usr/mdec/bootblk
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc64
primary bootstrap.
.
.It Pa /usr/mdec/ofwboot
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc64
secondary bootstrap.
.
.It Pa /ofwboot
Installed copy of
.Nx Ns Tn /sparc64
secondary bootstrap.
.
.El
.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss NetBSD/pmax examples
Install the Berkeley Fast File System primary bootstrap on to disk sd0:
.D1 Ic installboot /dev/rsd0c /usr/mdec/bootxx_ffs
.Pp
Remove the primary bootstrap from disk sd1:
.Dl Ic installboot -c /dev/swd1c
Install the ISO 9660 primary bootstrap in the file
.Pa /tmp/cd-image :
.Dl Ic installboot -m pmax /tmp/cd-image /usr/mdec/bootxx_cd9660
.Pp
Make an ISO 9660 filesystem in the file
.Pa /tmp/cd-image
and install the ISO 9660 primary bootstrap in the filesystem, where the
source directory for the ISO 9660 filesystem contains a kernel, the
primary bootstrap
.Pa bootxx_cd9660
and the secondary bootstrap
.Pa boot.pmax :
.Dl Ic mkisofs -o /tmp/cd-image -a -l -v iso-source-dir
.Dl ...
.Dl 48 51 iso-source-dir/bootxx_cd9660
.Dl ...
.Dl Ic installboot -b `expr 48 \e* 4` /tmp/cd-image /usr/mdec/bootxx_cd9660
.

.Sh HISTORY
This implementation of
.Nm
appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.
.Sh AUTHORS
The machine independent portion of this implementation of
.Nm
was written by Luke Mewburn.
The following people contributed to the various machine dependent
back-ends:
Simon Burge (pmax),
Chris Demetriou (alpha),
Matthew Green (sparc64),
Ross Harvey (alpha),
and
Matt Thomas (vax).
.
.Sh BUGS
There are not currently primary bootstraps to support all file systems
types which are capable of being the root file system.
.Ss NetBSD/pmax bugs
The
.Nx Ns Tn /pmax
secondary bootstrap program can only load kernels from file
systems starting at the beginning of disks.
.Pp
The size of primary bootstrap programs is restricted to 7.5KB, even
though some file systems (e.g. ISO 9660) are able to accommodate larger
ones.
