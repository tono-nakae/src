BUGS:
network interfaces (pollux) gets the media type all wrong.
the f4 popup isn't repainting the screen properly
multiselection popup causes chaos and destruction when you hit enter without
picking one.
fastpaths leave the terminal unusable after exiting.
required fields, aren't.
All of the /etc/*.conf menus need to be updated prior to release.
The ypinit stuff is all garbage.  It's an interactive command, meaning sushi
can't cope with it.
