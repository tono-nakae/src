.Sh NAME
.Nm lptctl
.Nd manipulate lpt devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lptctl
.Ar /dev/device
.Oo
.Op Ar command arg
.Ar ...
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to manipulate lpt devices so that a user can change how a
printer that is attached to a parallel port works.
If no command-argument pairs are specified, the status of the device
is printed to standard output using the following format:
.Pp
dma=[on|off] mode=[standard|nibble|ps2|fast|ecp|epp] ieee=[yes|no]
.Pp
The status information is also output after commands are carried out.
.Sh DEVICE COMMANDS
Multiple command-argument pairs can be specified up to a maximum
of the total number of distinct commands possible.
Available commands are:
.Bl -item
.It
.Cm dma
.Ar on | off
.Pp
Enables or disables DMA.
.It
.Cm mode
.Ar standard | nibble | ps2 | fast | ecp
.Ar | epp
.Pp
Sets port to use a mode of operation: standard centronics mode
(standard), nibble mode, bidirectional mode (ps2), fast centronics
mode (fast), enhanced capabilities port mode (ecp), or enhanced
parallel port mode (epp).
.It
.Cm ieee
.Ar yes | no
.Pp
Enables or disables the use of
.Tn IEEE 1284
negotiations during mode changes and channel direction changes.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
returns 0 on success, \*[Gt]0 on failure.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -item
.It
.Pa /dev/lpt?
- interrupt-driven printer ports
.It
.Pa /dev/lpa?
- polled printer ports
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
.Xr lpt 4 ,
.Xr ppbus 4
.Sh HISTORY
A similar utility called
.Nm lptcontrol
exists in
.Fx
to control the
.Xr lpt 4
device.
While similar in concept, the implementations are independent.
.Nm
was added in
.Nx 2.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This man page and the
.Nm
utility were written by Gary Thorpe.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
opens the printer device and causes device initialization if
.Pa /dev/lpa?
or
.Pa /dev/lpt?
are used.
Therefore, a printer must be connected and functioning to use this
utility or you will have to create a lpt device with an appropriate
minor number (see
.Xr lpt 4
for more details).
