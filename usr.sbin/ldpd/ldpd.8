.Sh NAME
.Nm ldpd
.Nd Label Distribution Protocol Daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl DdfhW
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility used to automatically distribute labels between two MPLS LSRs
almost conforming to RFC3036.
Right now it is in BETA stage and many features
are not implemented or may not work.
As a security measure you SHOULD filter the LDP well-known (646)
TCP and UDP ports using your favourite packet filter before starting
.Nm .
Also this is the current measure used to filter neighbours.
You should see some logs reported via
.Xr syslog 3
interface.
.Pp
You can increase the log verbosity using the
.Fl W
and
.Fl D
flags.
Also you can telnet to the control port (default: 2626) and use
this interface in order to get informations about protocol, neighbours
etc. but also to set runtime parameters.
The required password is the same as the root password.
.Pp
.Nm
computes existing routes and tries to match them on MPLS labels
announced by other LDP peers.
This means that
.Dq normal
routes will be changed into tagged routes, and MPLS routing table
will be populated.
It will also announce its mappings to its peers.
.Nm
will listen on a route socket and compute the necessary changes in
order to change untagged routes into tagged routes.
This means that one may use one's favourite dynamic routing protocol
daemon without modifications.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 15n
.It Fl D
Enable debug mode.
.It Fl d
Don't use route interception code.
.It Fl f
Run in foreground.
Use STDOUT for warning and debug messages.
.It Fl h
Outputs supported flags.
.It Fl p Ar port
Changes the TCP control port (default: 2626).
.It Fl W
Enable output of warning messages.
