/* MBR Message catalog -- English, i386 version */

message fullpart
{We are now going to install NetBSD on the disk %s.  You may
choose to install NetBSD on the entire disk, or on part of the disk.

Partial-disk installation creates a partition, or `slice', for NetBSD
in your disk's MBR partition table. Whole-disk installation is
`dangerously dedicated': it takes over the entire MBR. This WILL
overwrite all existing data and OSes on the disk. It also prohibits later
installation of multiple OSes on that disk (unless you overwrite NetBSD and
reinstall using only part of the disk).

Which would you like to do?
