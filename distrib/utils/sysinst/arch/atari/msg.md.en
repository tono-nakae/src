message md_hello
{If you booted from a floppy, you may now remove the disk.

}

message dobootblks
{Installing boot blocks on %s....
}

message askfsroot
{I will be asking for partition sizes and on some, mount points.

First the root partition.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
Root partition size? }

message askfsswap
{
Next the swap partition.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
Swap partition size? }

message askfsusr
{
Next the /usr partition.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
/usr partition size? }

message otherparts
{You still have some space remaining unallocated on your disk.  Please
give sizes and mount points for the following partitions.

}

message askfspart
{The next partition is /dev/%s%c.  You have %d %s left on your disk.
Partition size? }

message infoahdilabel
{You now have to prepare your root disk for the installation of NetBSD. This
is further referred to as 'labeling' a disk.

First you get the chance to edit or create an AHDI compatible partitioning on
the installation disk. Note that NetBSD can do without AHDI partitions,
check the documentation.
If you want to use an AHDI compatible partitioning, you have to assign some
partitions to NetBSD before NetBSD is able to use the disk. Change the 'id'
of all partitions you want to use for NetBSD file systems to 'NBD'. Change
the 'id' of the partition you wish to use for swap to 'SWP'.

Do you want AHDI compatible partitioning? }

message md_layout
{NetBSD uses a BSD disklabel to carve up the NetBSD portion of the disk
into multiple BSD partitions.  You must now set up your BSD disklabel.
You have several choices.  They are summarized below. 
-- Standard: the BSD disklabel partitions are computed by this program. 
-- Standard with X: twice the swap space, space for X binaries. 
-- Custom: you specify the sizes of all the BSD disklabel partitions. 
-- Use existing: use current partitions. You must assign mount points. 

Note: If you wish the NetBSD label and an AHDI compatible label to co-exist
on the same disk, you must use the existing layout!

The NetBSD part of your disk is %.2f Megabytes. 
Standard requires at least %.2f Megabytes. 
Standard with X requires at least %.2f Megabytes.
}

message emulbackup
{Either the /emul/aout or /emul directory on your system was a symbolic link
pointing to an unmounted file system. It has been given a '.old' extension.
Once you bring your upgraded system back up, you may need to take care
of merging the newly created /emul/aout directory with the old one.
}
