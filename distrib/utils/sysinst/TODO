Things to do ....

Phil:
	-- Make sure booting from ramdisk and fixed disk does the proper
           thing.  (Possibly adding a -m flag that says it is running in
           a memory disk root environment ... that could be set from the
           .profile on the ram disk.)  Things like having config_network()
           possibly use the information on the fixed disk instead of having
           to ask everything.

        -- Build the disktab as a profile, not a true /etc/disktab so it
           doesn't overwrite the real disktab.

        -- Have both ftp and floppy gets get the file, extract the file,
           and then remove the file before going on to the next set to
           save disk space.

        -- Add setting timezone

        -- A little more clean-up of the run_prog suite so things worke
           nicely for all ports.

        -- Check-in of files for amiga and other ports that will use
           sysinst for 1.3.

Jonathan:

    -- Clean up my DISKLABEL_CMD hack, make #define DISKLABEL_CMD
       properly MD, or at least provide a way to  not write disklabels 
       at on Amigas -- I assume Michael has something in his tree for that.

    -- fix "disklabel -r -w" vs. "disklabel -w": I still don't grok why
	the  -r, and the manpage says it will lose totally on sparcs.
	Phil, was there some reason to bypass the incore label on i386?
	Can we jst do "disklabel -w" everywhere?

    -- Make sure the in-memory disklabel structs are big enough
     	for the largest possible value of getmaxpartitions().
	Maybe allocate 32 entries and check at runtime that
	getmaxparitions < 32?
	(Yes, i forgot to check that when I first edited the code. Sorry.)


    -- add sanity-check  code that checks  that the
           installed/upgraded  target  disk has minimal
           prerequisites to boot.

          Check for the following in the target root, in order of paranoia:

          /netbsd
          /sbin
          /sbin/init
          /sbin/mount
          /bin/
          /bin/sh
          /sbin/mount{ffs,nfs,maybe others that appear in target fstab?}
          /etc/
          /etc/fstab
