.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program combines filesystem partitions for Sun Microsystems, Inc. computers into
an image suitable for writing to a compact disc, that will allow the disc
to be booted on the
.Em sun3 ,
.Em sun3x ,
.Em sun4 ,
.Em sun4c ,
.Em sun4m
and
.Em sun4u
platforms.
This hardware is supported by the
.Nx
.Em sparc ,
.Em sparc64
and
.Em sun3
ports.
The architecture arguments above must be the bootable filesystem images
for the named architecture.
.Ar filesystem
is typically an iso9660 filesystem, see
.Xr mount_cd9660 8
for details, but can be any type as long as the first 512 bytes of the
image are not used.
This image is modified, and the additional partitions added after this
partition, in order.
If any architecture image is missing, that partition is not used.
If a disc with
.Em sun4
and
.Em sun4m
support only was to be created, a dummy image
(e.g.,
.Pa /dev/null )
would need to be in place for
.Em sun4c .
.Pp
If the same boot image maybe used for multiple architectures (as the
.Nx Ns /sparc
ports for
.Em sun4 ,
.Em sun4c
and
.Em sun4m
allow), the same bootfile can be listed multiple times on the command line.
The
.Nm
program will detect this and only write one copy of the boot image.

.Sh NOTES
For the UltraSPARC line of computers, the PROM decodes a file in the first
partition of the CD-ROM, which must be an ISO9660 file-system, called
.Pa .slicemapfile .
The format of this file is an
.Dq m
followed by a partition number, starting at offset 0, plus an architecture
identifier, such as
.Dq sun4c
or
.Dq sun4u .
The UltraSPARC uses the
.Dq sun4u
partition as it's boot partition.
An example file that would be compatible with older hardware would look like:
.Bd -literal
        m       1       sun4
        m       2       sun4c
        m       3       sun4m
        m       4       sun4d
        m       5       sun4u
.Ed
.Pp
As such, to enable UltraSPARC booting, such a file must be present on the
image before
.Nm
adds bootable partitions to the image.

.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width x-v
.It Fl c
The
.Fl c
option sets cylinder size for this cd to
.Ar cylsz ,
which must be a multiple of 4.
The default cylinder size is 640.
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option turns on debugging output.
.It Fl v
The
.Fl v
option turns on verbose output.
