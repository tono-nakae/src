# copy the kernel
# We copy compressed kernel to "netbsd" rather than "netbsd.gz" for two reasons
#	1) shaves two seconds off the boot as the bootblocks look for netbsd first.
#	2) avoids possible moment of confusion when bootblocks 
#	print "no such file or directory" error before moving on to netbsd.gz

COPY	${OBJDIR}/netbsd		netbsd
