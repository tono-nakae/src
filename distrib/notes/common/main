.Ss "What is NetBSD?"
.
The
.Nx
Operating System is a fully functional UN*X-like system
derived from the Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2), 4.4BSD-Lite,
and 4.4BSD-Lite2 sources.
.Nx
runs on many architectures and is
being ported to more.
.Pp
.Nx
is a creation of the members of the Internet community.
Without the unique cooperation and coordination the net makes
possible, it's likely that this release wouldn't have come about.
.if \n[_FOR_RELEASE] \{\
.Pp
The
.Nx \*V
release is a landmark. Building upon the successful
.Nx
1.2 release, we have provided numerous and significant
functional enhancements, including support for many new devices,
integration of many bug fixes, new and updated kernel subsystems, and
many userland enhancements. The results of these improvements is a
stable operating system fit for production use that rivals most
commercially available systems.
.Pp
It is impossible to summarize the 18 months of development that went
into the
.Nx \*V
release. Some of the significant changes include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Support for machine independent device drivers has been
radically improved with the addition of the "bus.h" interface,
providing a high quality abstraction for machine and
architecture independent device access.
.It
The bus_dma interface has also been integrated, providing a
machine-independent abstraction for DMA mapping. This permits many
good things, including (among many) clean multi-platform
bounce buffer support.
.It
Framework support for ISA "Plug and Play" has been added, as
well as support for numerous "Plug and Play" devices.
.It
APM support has been added to NetBSD/i386.
.It
An initial cut of multi-platform PCMCIA support has been added.
.It
Support for ATAPI devices (initially just ATAPI CD-ROM drives)
has been added.
.It
Support for Sun 3/80s (sun3x architecture) has been added.
.It
Support for R4000 DECstations has been added.
.It
Integration/merger of 4.4BSD Lite-2 sources into userland
programs has nearly been completed.
.It
Most of userland now compiles with high levels of gcc warnings
turned on, which has lead to the discovery and elimination of
many bugs.
.It
The i386 boot blocks have been completely replaced with a new,
libsa based two stage boot system. This has permitted
integration of compressed boot support (see below).
.It
Many ports now support booting of compressed kernels, and
feature new "Single Floppy" install systems that boot
compressed install kernels and ramdisks. We intend to do
substantial work on improving ease of installation in the
future.
.It
"ypserv" has been added, thus completing our support for the
"yp" network information system suite.
.It
Support for the Linux "ext2fs" filesystem and for FAT32 "msdosfs"
filesystems has been added.
.It
TCP now has a SYN "compressed state engine" which provides
increased robustness under high levels of received SYNs (as in
the case of "SYN flood" attacks.) (Much of this code was
derived from sources provided by BSDI.)
.It
An initial implementation of Path MTU discovery has been
integrated (though it is not turned on by default).
.It
An initial kernel based random number generator pseudodevice has
been added.
.It
Several major fixes have been integrated for the VM subsystem,
including the fix of a notorious VM leak, improved
synchronization between mmap()ed and open()ed files, and
massively improved performance in low real memory conditions.
.It
A new swap subsystem has radically improved configuration and
management of swap devices and adds swapping to files.
.It
Userland ntp support, including xntpd, has been integrated.
.It
The audio subsystems have been substantially debugged and
improved, and now offer substantial emulation of the OSS audio
interface, thus providing the ability to cleanly run emulated
Linux and FreeBSD versions of sound intensive programs.
.It
A "packages" system has been adapted from FreeBSD and will
provide binary package installations for third party
applications.
.It
The XFree86 X source tree has been made a supported part of
the
.Nx
distribution, and X servers (if built for this
port), libraries and utilities are now shipped with our releases.
.It
The ftp(1) program has been made astoundingly overfunctional.
It supports command line editing, tab completion, status bars,
automatic download of URLs specified on the command line,
firewall support and many other features.
.It
All ports now use "new" config. Old config has been laid to rest.
.It
The ARP subsystem and API has been rewritten to make it less
ethernet-centric.
.It
A new if_media subsystem has been added which allows network
interfaces to be configured using media type names rather than
device-specific mode bits.
.It
Many kernel interface manual pages have been added to manual
section 9.
.It
Several ports support much more hardware.
.It
Many updates to bring
.Nx
closer to standards compliance.
.It
Most third party packages have been updated to the latest stable
release.
.El
As has been noted, there have also been innumerable bug fixes.	
.Pp
Kernel interfaces have continued to be refined, and more subsystems
and device drivers are shared among the different ports. You can look
for this trend to continue.
.Pp
.Nx \*V also includes some refinement to the
.Nx
binary emulation
system (which includes FreeBSD, HP-UX, iBCS2, Linux, OSF/1, SunOS, SVR4,
Solaris and Ultrix compatibility), bringing
.Nx
closer to the goal of
making the emulation as accurate as possible.
.Pp
In the near future, we hope to integrate a fully rewritten Virtual
Memory subsystem, kernel threads, and SMP support.

.Ss "The Future of NetBSD"
.
The
.Nx
Foundation has been incorporated as a non-profit
organization. Its purpose is to encourage, foster and promote the
free exchange of computer software, namely the
.Nx
Operating
System. The foundation will allow for many things to be handled more
smoothly than could be done with our previous informal organization.
In particular, it provides the framework to deal with other parties
that wish to become involved in the
.Nx
Project.
.Pp
The
.Nx
Foundation will help improve the quality of
.Nx
by:
.Bl -bullet
.It
providing better organization to keep track of development
efforts, including co-ordination with groups working in 
related fields.
.It
providing a framework to receive donations of goods and
services and to own the resources necessary to run the
.Nx
Project.
.It
providing a better position from which to undertake
promotional activities.
.It
periodically organizing workshops for developers and other
interested people to discuss ongoing work.
.El
We hope to have regular releases of the full binary and source trees,
but these are difficult to coordinate, especially with all of the
architectures which we now support! 
.Pp
We hope to support even
.Em more
hardware in the future, and we have a
rather large number of other ideas about what can be done to improve
.Nx .
.Pp
We intend to continue our current practice of making the
NetBSD-current development source available on a daily basis.
.Pp
We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
will provide them, providing that they are well thought-out and
increase the usability of the system.
.Pp
Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of
.Nx
users, because it is for
and because of them that
.Nx
exists.

.It Li patches/
Post-release source code patches.
.It Li source/
Source distribution sets; see below.
.El
.Pp
In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures for which
.Nx \*V
has a binary distribution. There are also
\&'README.export-control' files sprinkled liberally throughout the
distribution tree, which point out that there are some portions of the
distribution (i.e. the `domestic' portion) that may be subject to
export regulations of the United States.  It is your responsibility
to determine whether or not it is legal for you to export these portions
and to act accordingly.
.Pp
The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
"source" subdirectory of the distribution tree. They contain the 
complete sources to the system. The source distribution sets 
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width sharesrc.tgz...
.It secrsrc.tgz:
This set contains the "domestic" sources. These
sources may be subject to United States export
regulations.
.br
.Em 412K gzipped, 1.8M uncompressed
.It gnusrc.tgz:
This set contains the "gnu" sources, including
the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution
sets.
.br
.Em 15.6M gzipped, 66.4M uncompressed
.It syssrc.tgz:
This set contains the sources to the
.Nx \*V
kernel, config(8), and dbsym(8).
.br
.Em 10.7M gzipped, 50.0M uncompressed
.It sharesrc.tgz:
This set contains the "share" sources, which include
the sources for the man pages not associated with
any particular program, the sources for the
typesettable document set, the dictionaries, and more.
.br
.Em 2.9M gzipped, 11.1M uncompressed
.It src.tgz:
This set contains all of the
.Nx \*V
sources which
are not mentioned above.
.br
.Em 13.9M gzipped, 60.7M uncompressed
.El
.Pp
Most of the above source sets are located in the
.Pa source/sets
subdirectory of the distribution tree. The secrsrc.tgz set is
contained in the
.Pa source/security
subdirectory. This set, which is
available only to users in the United States and Canada, contains the
sources normally found in
.Pa /usr/src/domestic
\- primarily kerberos and
other cryptographic security related software. (Remember, because of
United States law, it may not be legal to distribute this set to
locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
.Pp
The source sets are distributed as compressed tar files. They may be
unpacked into
.Pa /usr/src
with the command:
.D1 Ic "cat set_name.tgz | gunzip | (cd /; tar xpf - )
.No The Pa sets/Split/
.No and Pa security/Split/
subdirectories contain split
versions of the source sets for those users who need to load the
source sets from floppy or otherwise need a split distribution. The
split sets are are named "set_name.xx" where "set_name" is the
distribution set name, and "xx" is the sequence number of the file,
starting with "aa" for the first file in the distribution set, then
"ab" for the next, and so on. All of these files except the last one
of each set should be exactly 240,640 bytes long. (The last file is
just long enough to contain the remainder of the data for that
distribution set.)
.Pp
The split distributions may be reassembled and extracted with
.Ic cat No as follows:
.D1 Ic "cat set_name.?? | gunzip | (cd /; tar xpf - )
.Pp
In each of the source distribution set directories, there is a file
named
.Pa CKSUMS
which contains the checksums of the files in that
directory, as generated by the
.Xr cksum 1
utility. You can use cksum to
check the integrity of the archives, if you suspect that one of the
files is corrupt and have access to a cksum binary. Checksums based on
other algorithms may also be present \*- see the
.Xr release 7
man page for details.

Users upgrading from previous versions of
.Nx
may wish to bear the
following problems and compatibility issues in mind when upgrading to
.Nx \*V
.
.
.Bl -bullet
.It
Swap configuration
.
.
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Description
All swap partitions are now configured by the swapctl(8)
program. The kernel no longer configures a default swap
partition. Because of this, all swap partitions
.No must be listed in Pa /etc/fstab .
.Pp
Many users of previous releases relied on the kernel
configuring a "default" swap partition and did not list any swap space in
.Pa /etc/fstab
at all -- such users will now have no
swap space configured unless they list swap partitions in
.Pa /etc/fstab !
.Pp
Common symptoms of of this problem include machine crashes
during builds, and similar memory intensive activities.
.It Fix
The most common position for a swap partition is the `b'
partition of the drive the root file system is on. For
diskless systems, check the new swapctl(8) manual for more
detail on how this is done. Example fstab entries:
.
.Bl -column /dev/sd0bxx nonexx swapxx sw,priority=0xx
.It /dev/sd0b Ta none Ta swap Ta sw,priority=0
.It /dev/sd1b Ta none Ta swap Ta sw,priority=5
.El
.
.El
.
.It
NFS now uses reserved ports
.
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Description
Earlier versions of
.Nx
did not use a reserved (\*(<= 1023)
port when making NFS client requests. When acting as a server
NetBSD now requires reserved ports by default.
.Pp
Old clients mounting a new server will receive a 'permission
denied' response when the directory is accessed. New clients
should work fine with old servers.
.It Fix
Add '-P' to the mount options in the old client's
.Pa /etc/fstab ,
or (less preferred), add
.Li \&-noresvport,noresvmnt
to the options on the new server's
.Pa /etc/exports .
.El
.
.It
NFS daemons and other programs in /sbin moved
.
.Bl -tag -width 3n
.It Description
The NFS daemons (nfsd, nfsiod, mountd) have been moved from
the
.Pa /sbin
to the
.Pa /usr/sbin directory .
When new binaries are
loaded over old ones during upgrade, most programs get
overlaid and replaced, but unless these binaries are
explicitly removed they will not disappear. The installation
subsystems on some
.Nx
architectures will not properly
remove these binaries.
.Pp
Due to changes in the NFS subsystem, the old NFS daemon
binaries will not work correctly, and will cause serious
problems. Unfortunately, the default startup script
.Pq Pa /etc/rc
will run the old binaries in
.Pa /sbin
if they are present instead of the new ones in
.Pa /usr/sbin .
.Pp
Some other programs (dumpfs, dumplfs and quotacheck) have also
been moved from
.Pa /sbin
to
.Pa /usr/sbin ,
and old versions may be
left behind by accident. They, too, may cause difficulties.
.It Fix
Remove the old daemon binaries
.Pp Pa (/sbin/nfsiod ,
.Pa /sbin/nfsd ,
.Pa /sbin/mountd ,
.Pq etc.
after your upgrade has finished. You may
wish to do an 
.D1 Ic "ls -lt /sbin | more
to help determine which
binaries were not replaced/removed during your upgrade.

(The Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, from

Due to a change in the output of dump(8) to ensure

.Pp
The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.
.Pp
.No The Em man
command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering
.Ic man Op Ar section
.Ar topic .
The brackets
.Op \&
around the

optional. If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
lowest numbered section name will be displayed. For instance, after
logging in, enter 
.D1 Ic "man passwd
to read the documentation for
.Xr passwd 1 .
To view the documentation for
.Xr passwd 5 m
enter
.D1 Ic man 5 passwd
instead.
.Pp
If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter
