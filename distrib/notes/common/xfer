EISA or SCSI (i.e. ISA-only), but can be used on machines with only
4 MB of RAM.

If you are using a UN*X-like system to write the floppy images to

Some other machines or systems are still required to write floppy images

SCSI devices on NWS-12x0 machines are not supported (yet), so they

the server.

The steps for the various media are outlined below.

To install
.Nx
from an AmigaDOS partition, you need to get the

distribution sets you wish to install on your system on to an AmigaDOS
partition.
All of the

pieces can be placed in a single directory instead of separate ones for each
distribution set.
This will also simplify the installation work later on.

step in the installation process, preparing your hard disk.

A1200 or A4000 internal IDE connector.
If it is a SCSI CD-ROM on a non-supported SCSI bus like Blizzard-3 SCSI
or Apollo SCSI you must first copy the distribution sets to an AmigaDOS
partition as described above.
.Pp
If your SCSI CD-ROM is connected to a supported SCSI host adapter,

(If the floppies are bootable, then the

system files that make them bootable will take up some space, and you
won't be able to fit the distribution set parts on the disks.)
If you're using floppies that are formatted for
.Tn DOS
by their manufacturers, they probably aren't bootable, and you can use
them out of the box.

section on upgrading.

.It Em FTP
The preparations for this installation/upgrade method are
easy; all you need to do is make sure that there's an FTP
site from which you can retrieve the
.Nx
distribution when you're about to
install or upgrade.
You need to know the numeric IP address of that site, and,
if it's not on a network directly connected to the machine
on which you're installing or upgrading
.Nx ,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the
.Nx
machine.
Finally, you need to know the numeric IP address of the
.Nx
machine itself.
If you don't have access to a functioning nameserver during
installation, the IP address of
.Sy ftp.netbsd.org
is
.Li 204.152.184.75
(as of October, 2000).
.Pp
Once you have this information, you can proceed to the next
step in the installation or upgrade process.
If you're installing
.Nx
from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard disk, below.
If you're upgrading an existing installation, go directly to
the section on upgrading.
.(Note
This method of installation is recommended only for those already familiar
with using BSD network configuration and management commands.
If you aren't, this documentation should help, but is not intended to
be all-encompassing.
.Note)

.if r_x68k \{\
.It Em M-O disk
To install
.Nx
from a device such as a removable SCSI disk or a magneto-optical disk,
the media
.Em must
be of the IBM
.Em Super-floppy
format.
The Human68k format is not recognized by this release of the
.Nx*M .
If you have a
.Tn DOS
or MS-Windows
machine with an M-O drive connected, use it.
If you don't, and if you have a program to handle IBM format M-O
for Human68k, copy all the files in the subdirectory
.Pa x68k/binaries

.\} \" r_x68k
.
.It Em NFS
Place the
.Nx
distribution sets you wish to install into a
directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading
.Nx .
This will probably require modifying the
.Pa /etc/exports
file on of the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
privileges on the server.)
.Pp
You need to know the numeric IP address of the NFS server,
and, if the server is not on a network directly connected to
the machine on which you're installing or upgrading
.Nx ,
you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
to the
.Nx
machine.
Finally, you need to know the numeric IP address of the
.Nx
machine itself.

Once the NFS server is set up properly and you have the
information mentioned above, you can proceed to the next step
in the installation or upgrade process.

If you're upgrading an existing installation, go directly to the
section on upgrading.

be all-encompassing.

.if !r_news68k \{\
.It Em Tape
To install
.Nx
from a tape, you need to make a tape that
contains the distribution set files, in "tar" format.
.(Note
the tape devices with which
.Nx*M
is believed to work is the DEC
TK-50. This is a very slow device.  Installation via disk or network is
recommended if at all possible.
.Note)
.Pp
If you're making the tape on a UN*X-like system, the easiest way
to do so is probably something like:
.D1 Ic tar -cf Ar tape_device dist_directories
.No where Ar tape_device
is the name of the tape device that
describes the tape drive you're using; possibly
.Pa /dev/rst0 ,
or something similar, but it will vary from system to system.
(If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.)
In the above example,
.Ar dist_directories
are the
distribution sets' directories, for the distribution sets you
wish to place on the tape.
For instance, to put the
.Sy misc, base, No and Sy etc
distributions on tape (in
order to do the absolute minimum installation to a new disk),
you would do the following:
.D1 Ic cd \&.../NetBSD-\*V         # the top of the tree
.D1 Ic cd \*M/binary
And then:\ \~
.D1 Ic tar -cf Ar tape_device misc etc kern
.Pp
.(Note
You still need to fill in
.Ar tape_device No in the example.
.Note)
.Pp
Once you have the files on the tape, you can proceed to the
next step in the installation or upgrade process.
If you're installing
.Nx
from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard disk, below.
If you're upgrading an existing installation, go directly to the section
on upgrading.
