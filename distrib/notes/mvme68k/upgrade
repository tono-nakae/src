It is possible to easily upgrade your existing NetBSD/mvme68k system
using the upgrade program in the miniroot. If you wish to upgrade
your system by this method, simply select the `upgrade' option once
the miniroot has booted. The upgrade program with then guide you
through the procedure. The upgrade program will:

        * Enable the network based on your system's current
          network configuration.

        * Mount your existing filesystems.

        * Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.

        * Fixup your system's existing /etc/fstab, and if necessary,
          changing the occurrences of `ufs' to `ffs' and let you
          edit the resulting file.

        * Make new device nodes in your root filesystem.

        * Copy a new kernel onto your root partition.
          NOTE: the existing kernel WILL NOT be backed up; doing
          so would be pointless, since older kernels may not be
          capable of running NetBSD _VER executables.

        * Install a new boot block.

        * Check your filesystems for integrity.

While using the miniroot's upgrade program is the preferred method
of upgrading your system, it is possible to upgrade your system
manually. To do this, follow the following procedure:

        * Place _at least_ the `base' binary set in a filesystem
          accessible to the target machine. A local filesystem
          is preferred, since the NFS subsystem in the NetBSD _VER
          kernel may be incompatible with your old binaries.

        * Back up your pre-existing kernel and copy the _VER
          kernel into your root partition.

        * Reboot with the _VER kernel into single-user mode.

        * Check all filesystems:

                /sbin/fsck -pf

        * Mount all local filesystems:

                /sbin/mount -a -t nonfs

        * If you keep /usr or /usr/share on an NFS server, you
          will want to mount those filesystems as well. To do
          this, you will need to enable the network:

                sh /etc/netstart

        * Run the update(8) daemon, to ensure that new programs
          are actually stored on disk.

                update

        * Make sure you are in the root filesystem and extract
          the `base' binary set:

                cd /
                tar --unlink -zxvpf /path/to/base.tgz

          NOTE: the `--unlink' option is _very_ important!

        * Delete system files in /sbin which now live in /usr/sbin:

                cd /sbin
                rm -f mountd rtquery quotacheck dumpfs dumplfs

        * Install a new boot block (you may need to be running in
          single-user mode to do this...):

                cd /usr/mdec
                cp bootsd /.bootsd
                ./installboot /.bootsd bootxx <root disk, e.g. /dev/rsd0a>

        * Sync the filesystems:

                sync

        * At this point you may extract any other binary sets
          you may have placed on local filesystems, or you may
          wish to extract additional sets at a later time.
          To extract these sets, use the following commands:

                cd /
                tar --unlink -zxvpf <path to set>

NOTE: you SHOULD NOT extract the `etc' set if upgrading. Instead, you
should extract that set into another area and carefully merge the changes
by hand.
