NetBSD/mvme68k \*V runs on Motorola
.Tn MVME147 No boards.
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~100MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space (approx.
200MB additional space is necessary for full sources. Double that if you
want to recompile it all!). To run X (clients only) or compile the system,
more RAM is recommended. Good performance requires 8MB of RAM, or 16 MB
when running the X Window System.
.Pp
Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
partition:      advise          needed
root (/)        20M             12M
user (/usr)     100M            80M
swap            (2 or 3 * RAM)   8M
Anything else is up to you!
.Ed
.Pp
Note that the \*m installation procedure uses a
.Em miniroot
image which is placed into the swap area of the disk. The swap partition
must be large enough to hold this miniroot image (\*> 6Mb).
.Pp
