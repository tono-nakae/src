The mvme68k-specific portion of the NetBSD _VER release is found in the
"mvme68k" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../NetBSD-_VER/mvme68k/
                        INSTALL         Installation notes; this file.

                        installation/   Boot programs, a stand-alone
                                        RAMDISK kernel, and a miniroot
                                        filesystem image. see below.

                        binary/         mvme68k binary distribution sets;
                                        see below.

                        security/       mvme68k security distribution;
                                        see below.

.../mvme68k/installation/
                        miniroot/       The miniroot filesystem image.

						netboot/		Two programs needed to boot a
										VME147 kernel over the network.

						tapeimage/      Tape boot programs, and a RAMDISK
									    kernel.

The NetBSD/mvme68k install distribution contains files that can be
used to install NetBSD onto a completely "bare" VME147.  The files
in the "mvme68k/installation/*" directories are described below:

        miniroot.gz     A gzipped copy of the miniroot filesystem.
                        This image is to be un-gzipped and copied
                        into the swap area of a disk.

        netbsd-rd.gz    A gzipped copy of the "RAMDISK kernel"
                        for installing the miniroot filesystem.

        stboot          A tape boot-block, in the form required to
                        allow 147-Bug to boot from tape. This is the
                        first segment of a boot tape.

        bootst          A copy of the tape boot program, used
                        as the second segment of a boot tape.

        sboot           A copy of the serial boot program. This is
                        necessary if you don't have a tape drive,
                        but you _do_ have another system which can
                        act as a boot and NFS server. This is also
                        useful if you are installing a diskless
                        NetBSD/mvme68k system.

        netboot         A copy of the network boot program. Used
                        in conjunction with sboot to get your system
                        booted over a network.

These files can be used to make a boot tape suitable for installing
NetBSD/mvme68k. These files can also be used to configure an NFS server
to support installation "over the network".  See the section "Getting
the NetBSD System onto Useful Media" for instructions on either method.

.../mvme68k/binary/sets

The NetBSD/mvme68k binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the NetBSD _VER release for the VME147. There are seven binary
distribution sets, and the "security" distribution set. The binary
distribution sets are as follows:

        base    The NetBSD/mvme68k _VER base binary distribution. You
                MUST install this distribution set. It contains the
                base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the
                system to run and be minimally functional. It includes
                shared library support, and excludes everything
                described below.
                [ 9.2M gzipped, 26.5M uncompressed ]

        comp    The NetBSD/mvme68k Compiler tools. All of the tools
                relating to C and C++. This set includes the system
                include files (/usr/include), the linker, the compiler
                tool chain, and the various system libraries (except
                the shared libraries, which are included as part of the
                base set). This set also includes the manual pages for
                all of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
                call and library manual pages.
                [ 6.9M gzipped, 24.1M uncompressed ]

        etc     This distribution set contains the system configuration
                files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
                This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
                system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
                upgrading. (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
                you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
                configuration files by hand.)
                [ 53K gzipped, 327K uncompressed ]

        games   This set includes the games and their manual pages.
                [ 2.9M gzipped, 7.5M uncompressed ]

        man     This set includes all of the manual pages for the
                binaries and other software contained in the base set.
                Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
                that are included in the other sets.
                [ 2.5K gzipped, 10.3M uncompressed ]

        misc    This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
                rather large), the typesettable document set, and
                man pages for other architectures which happen to be
                installed from the source tree by default.
                [ 2.3M gzipped, 8.7M uncompressed ]

        text    This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
                including groff, all related programs, and their
                manual pages.
                [ 1.0M gzipped, 3.9M uncompressed ]

.../mvme68k/security/

The mvme68k security distribution set is named "secr" and can be found
in the "mvme68k/security" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution
tree. It contains executables which are built in the "src/domestic" portion
of the NetBSD source tree. It can only be found on those sites which carry
the complete NetBSD distribution and that can legally obtain it. (Remember,
because of United States law, it may not be legal to distribute this set to
locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
[ 128K gzipped, 275K uncompressed ]

.../mvme68k/kernel/

The mvme68k kernel directory contains a gzip'ed VME147 specific kernel
image. This should be used when upgrading from a previous version of
NetBSD. Before starting the upgrade, you should unzip and copy this
kernel in place of your existing /netbsd image, then reboot.

The mvme68k binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files.
Each mvme68k binary distribution set also has its own "CKSUMS" file, just
as the source distribution sets do.

The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the command:

        pax -zrvpe -f set.tar.gz

from /.

For best results, it is recommended that you follow the installation
and/or upgrade procedures documented in this file.
