This is the fourth public release of NetBSD for the Amiga line of
computers. Several additional graphics, network and SCSI boards are
now supported, as well as the 68060 CPU. IBM encoded floppy disks can
now be read and written (raw, Berkeley FFS and MSDOS file system;
however, we still can't write the ADOS file system).

This release should also work on early DraCo models, which still have
a CIA timer. Note, however, that only on-board keyboard, on-board SCSI,
on-board serial, the Altais graphics board, and non-DMA Zorro-II
devices are supported on these machines; no parallel device and no
floppy drives yet.
