NetBSD/news68k \*V will run on single m68030-based Sony NEWS workstations.
They include the NWS-14x0, NWS-15x0, PWS-15x0, NWS-17x0,
and NWS-12x0 machines.  NetBSD/news68k does not currently support
m68020-based machines (NWS-700, NWS-800) nor I/O processor based
machines (NWS-800, NWS-1800).
.Pp
NetBSD/news68k \*V does not support any framebuffers so
.Em you have to use serial console
to install NetBSD/news68k.
.Pp
NetBSD/news68k \*V does not support SCSI on NWS-12x0 machines,
so installations on NWS-12x0 must use a remote NFS filesystem.
.Pp
MIPS based NEWS workstations (NWS-3xxx or NWS-5000) are
supported by NetBSD/newsmips.
