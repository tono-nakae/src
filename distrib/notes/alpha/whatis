There have been many, many Alpha-specific enchancements since the
1.2 release. These include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Supporting more system types (including the 8200/8400).
.It
Making many more device drivers (mostly from the i386 port)
work on the alpha.
.It
Changing the object file format from COFF to ELF, and adding
shared library support
.El
NetBSD \*V on alpha is, as usual, also fully backward compatible
with old NetBSD/alpha binaries, so you don't need to recompile all
your local programs.
