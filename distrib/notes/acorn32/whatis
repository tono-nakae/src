This is the fourth major release of
.Nx
for the \*M ,
although it was known as
.Nx Ns /arm32
prior to
.Nx 1.6 .
.Pp
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx
\*M binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
.Pp
New port-specific features include:
.(bullet
The RiscBSD console system, including the
.Xr kbd 4
and
.Xr vt 4
drivers, has finally been withdrawn.
.Nx*M
now always uses
.Xr wscons .
.It
The
.Xr asc 4
driver for the Acorn SCSI Expansion Card has been replaced in the
distribution kernels with a new, machine-independent driver,
.Xr sec 4 .
Custom kernels can still use
.Xr asc 4
for now, but it is expected to be withdrawn in the next release.
