The minimal configuration requires 16 MB of RAM and ~60 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended, as
.Nx
with 4 MB of RAM feels like Solaris with 4 MB of RAM - slow.
Note that until you have around 16 MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.

Sbus ethernet drivers current have a problem with interrupts and
do not perform properly except in extreme low usage conditions, rendering
them effectively unusable.

Access to devices on the secondary PCIIDE channel currently do not work.

.Pp
There are a large number of untested PCI drivers that have never
been tested on UltraSPARC PCI systems that may "just work".
