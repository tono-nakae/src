This is the XXXth major release of
.Nx*M .
Previous versions of
.Nx
supported the \*M platform as part of
.Nx Ns /arm32 .
.Pp
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, fully backward compatible with old
.Nx
binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
