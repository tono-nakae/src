First and foremost, before beginning the installation process,
.Em make sure you have a reliable backup
of any data (e.g., an old IRIX installation) you wish to preserve.
.Pp
Booting
.Nx*M
for the first time is most commonly done from the network. You must
set up DHCP, TFTP, and NFS for the installation procedure to be
successful. Some SGI bootproms, such as the ones found on O2s, can read
ELF kernels directly from the network, others require that you boot
an ECOFF version of the kernel. You can convert the standard ELF
format kernel into an ECOFF kernel using the
.Pa elf2ecoff
tool.
.Pp
Note that some older bootproms have an interesting bug in reading the
kernel via TFTP. They handle the port number as a signed entity, and
can thus not connect to ports >32767. You can work around this problem
on the TFTP server (given that it is a NetBSD host) by using
.Dq sysctl
to set
.Dq net.inet.ip.anonportmin
and
.Dq net.inet.ip.anonportmax
to more suitable values.
.Pp
The O2 internal MACE Ethernet chip isn't supported yet, so to boot the O2
and mount nfsroot, you will need an external NIC in the PCI slot.
