The steps taken for installing
.Nx*M
are different for diskless and hard disk configurations.
.Ss2 Installation for diskless configurations
This sections assumes you know how to configure DHCP, TFTP,
and NFS services on your server.
.Pp
.(enum
Place the kernel into the TFTP server's download area.  If the
kernel has a
.Dq .gz
suffix, you must first uncompress it using the
.Pa gunzip
program. You must also decide which kernel you need to boot. Because of
differences in SGI hardware between different machines, the kernel load
addresses differ. You will need GENERIC_INDY for the Indy and Indigo2,
while GENERIC should be enough for the O2.
.Pp
.Dl server# Ic cp netbsd-GENERIC /tftpboot/netbsd-sgimips
.Dl server# Ic cp netbsd-GENERIC_INDY /tftpboot/netbsd-sgimips-indy
.Pp
Note that your DHCP server must be configured to specify
this file as the boot file for the client.
.It
Unpack the distribution sets into the client's root directory
on the server.
.Pp
.Dl server# Ic cd /export/client/mipseb
.Dl server# Ic gzcat .../base.tgz | tar xvpf -
.Dl server# Ic gzcat .../etc.tgz | tar xvpf -
.Dl [ repeat for all sets you wish to unpack ]
.It
Load the kernel from the TFTP server:
.Pp
.Dl > setenv SystemPartition bootp():
.Dl > setenv netaddr your.ip.here.please
.Dl > boot
.enum)
For more tricks with the bootprom, try reading the "prom" manual page
on found on IRIX.
.Pp
The installation of your diskless
.Nx*M
system is now complete!  You may now skip ahead to any post-installation
instructions.
