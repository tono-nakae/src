.Nx*M
\*V runs on a
.Tn PC532
computer. It supports a subset of the
.Dq standard
hardware to date. This is defined as:
.(bullet -compact
4 MB of memory
.It
8 serial lines done by 4 scn2681 chips
.It
the NCR DP8490 SCSI chip (scsi only)
.(bullet -compact
Most SCSI disks work (fixed and floppy)
.It
A few SCSI tapes work
.It
Some SCSI CD-ROM drives work
.bullet)
.It
The Matthias Pfaller Parallel Port.

.Nx*M
currently expects the ROM monitor to be the "autoboot
monitor" of Oct/Nov 1991. It includes support to set up auto booting
of NetBSD, including a secondary boot program that the autoboot monitor
will load that in turn loads the NetBSD kernel from a NetBSD file system.
Source and ROM images of the autoboot monitor are located at
.Lk ftp://ftp.cs.wwu.edu/pub/pc532/mon.auto.tar.gz
.Pp
Most of the pc532 specific development of
.Nx*M
was done on a
machine with 8 MB of memory. It should run with 4 MB of memory
although it may be slower.
