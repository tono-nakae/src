NetBSD/sun3 \*V runs on most Sun3 machines, including:
.Bl -column -offset indent 3/260 3/280 3/160
.       It 3/50 Ta 3/60 Ta 3/110
.       It 3/75 Ta 3/150 Ta 3/160
.       It 3/260 Ta 3/280 Ta 3/E
.El
.Pp
NetBSD/sun3 \*V does not run on the Sun3/80 (sun3x class)
but that is presently handled as a separate distribution.
Use NetBSD/sun3x for Sun3/80 and Sun3/470 support.
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and about 80MB of disk
space.  To install the entire system requires much more disk space
(approx. 100MB additional space is necessary for full sources).
To run X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  Good
performance requires 8MB of RAM, or 16 MB when running the
X Window System.
.Pp
Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
.Bl -column -offset indent local\ (/usr/local) Advised With\ X Needed With\ X
.       It Partition Ta Advised Ta With\ X Ta Needed Ta With\ X
.       It root\ (/)    Ta 20M  Ta 20M  Ta 15M  Ta 15M
.       It user\ (/usr) Ta 95M  Ta 125M Ta 75M  Ta 105M
.       It swap         Ta ram*2\ \&...
.       It local\ (/usr/local) Ta up\ to\ you\ \&...
.El
.Pp
As you may note, the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree as
you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is large
and bulky to accommodate all people).
.Pp
Note that the sun3 installation procedure uses a `miniroot' image
which is placed into the swap area of the disk.  The swap partition
must be at least as large as the miniroot image (8MB).
