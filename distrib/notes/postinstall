	Once you've got the operating system running, there are a few
	things you need to do in order to bring the system into a propperly
	configured state, with the most important ones described below.


1. Configuring /etc/rc.conf

	If you haven't done any configuration of /etc/rc.conf, the system
	will drop you into single user mode on first reboot with the
	message

	   /etc/rc.conf is not configured. Multiuser boot aborted.

	and the root filesystem mounted read-write. When the system
	asks you to choose a shell, simply hit return to get to a
	prompt.  If you are asked for a terminal type, respond with
	'vt220' (or whatever is appropriate for your terminal type)
	and hit return.  At this point, you need to configure at least
	one file in the /etc directory.  Change to the /etc directory
	and take a look at the /etc/rc.conf file.  Modify it to your
	tastes, making sure that you set "rc_configured=YES" so that
	your changes will be enabled and a multi-user boot can
	proceed.  If your /usr directory is on a separate partition
	and you do not know how to use 'ed' or 'ex', you will have to
	mount your /usr partition to gain access to 'vi'.  Do the
	following:

	   mount /usr
	   export TERM=vt220

	If you have /var on a seperate partition, you need to repeat
	that step for it. After that, you can edit /etc/rc.conf with
	'vi'.  When you have finished, type 'exit' at the prompt to
	leave the single-user shell and continue with the multi-user
	boot.

	Other values that need to be set in /etc/rc.conf for a networked
	environment are `hostname' and possibly `defaultroute', furthermore
	add an ifconfig_int for your interface <int>, along the lines of

	   ifconfig_de0="inet 123.45.67.89 netmask 255.255.255.0"

	or, if you have myname.my.dom in /etc/hosts:

	   ifconfig_de0="inet myname.my.dom netmask 255.255.255.0"

	To enable proper hostname resolution, you will also want to add an
	/etc/resolv.conf file or (if you are feeling a little more
	adventurous) run named.  See resolv.conf(5) or named(8) for more
	information.
	

2. Logging in

	After reboot, you can log in as "root" at the login prompt.  There
	is no initial password, but if you're using the machine in a
	networked environment, you should create an account for yourself
	(see below) and protect it and the "root" account with good
	passwords.


3. Adding accounts

	Use the `vipw' command to add accounts to your system, DO NOT
	edit /etc/passwd directly. See adduser(8) for more information
	on the process of how to add a new user to the system.


4. The X Window System

	If you have installed the X window system, look at the files in
	/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc for information.

	On NetBSD/i386 and NetBSD/arm32, you will need to set up a
	configuration file, see /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config.eg for an
	example. See http://www.xfree86.org/ and the XFree86 manual page
	for more information.

	NetBSD/pmax _VER uses an X11R5 X server. These servers cannot read
	the compressed fonts which are shipped with standard X11R6
	configurations. You must take post-installation steps to make the
	X11R5 server work with the fonts that are standard for X11R6.3.
	The distribution file /usr/X11R6/bin/README.pmax contains
	information on how to choose an Xserver and how to access
	compressed fonts via a font server or to decompress the X fonts
	after installation.  Please follow the directions there.

	Don't forget to add /usr/X11R6/bin to your path in your shell's dot
	file so that you have access to the X binaries.


5. Installing 3rd party packages

	There is a lot of software freely available for Unix based systems,
	which usually runs on NetBSD, too, sometimes with some
	modifications. The NetBSD packages collection incorporates any such
	changes necessary to make that software run on NetBSD, and makes
	the installation (and deinstallation) of the software packages
	easy. There's also the option of building a package from source, in
	case there's no precompiled binary available.

	Precompiled binaries can be found at

	   ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/

	Package sources for compiling packages can be obtained by
	retrieving the file

	   ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/tar_files/pkgsrc.tar.gz

	and extracting it into /usr/pkgsrc. See /usr/pkgsrc/README then for
	more information.


6. Misc

 - To adjust the system to your local timezone, point the /etc/localtime
   symlink to the appropriate file under /usr/share/zoneinfo.

 - Edit /etc/aliases to forward root mail to the right place (run
   `newaliases' afterwards)

 - The /etc/sendmail.cf file will almost definitely need to be adjusted;
   files aiding in this can be found in /usr/share/sendmail. See the 
   README-file there for more information.

 - Edit /etc/rc.local to run any local daemons you use.

 - Many of the /etc files are documented in section 5 of the manual; so
   just invoking "man <filename>" is likely to give you more information on
   these files.
