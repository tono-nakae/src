The Atari-specific portion of the NetBSD _VER release is found in the
"atari" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../NetBSD-_VER/atari/
			SOURCE_DATE	the date, in the default format
					produced by the date(1) command,
					of the source that the release was
					built from

			INSTALL		these installation notes

			binary/		atari system binaries;
					see below.

			installation/	installation helper items

The NetBSD/atari system binaries include the NetBSD/atari binary
distribution sets, additional kernels, and security-related system
binaries.  The NetBSD _VER release for the atari port comprises those
files found in the "atari/binary/sets" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER
distribution tree.  There are seven system distribution sets, two
kernel distribution sets, and four X distribution sets.  The files in the
"sets" subdirectory are as follows:

	base.tgz	The NetBSD/atari _VER base binary distribution.
			You MUST install this distribution set.  It
			contains the base NetBSD utilities that are
			necessary for the system to run and be minimally
			functional.  It includes shared library support,
			and excludes everything described below.
			[ 8.6M gzipped, 25.1M uncompressed ]

	comp.tgz	The NetBSD/atari Compiler tools; all of the tools
			relating to C and C++.  This set includes the
			system include files (/usr/include), the linker,
			the compiler tool chain, and the various system
			libraries (except the shared libraries, which are
			included as part of the base set).  This set also
			includes the manual pages for all of the utilities
			it contains, as well as the system call and library
			manual pages. 
			[ 6.2M gzipped, 21.6M uncompressed ]

	etc.tgz		This distribution set contains the system
			configuration files that reside in /etc and in
			several other places.  This set MUST be installed
			if you are installing the system from scratch, but
			should NOT be used if you are upgrading.  (If you
			are upgrading, it's recommended that you get a copy
			of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
			configuration files by hand.) 
			[ 49K gzipped, 288K uncompressed ]

	games.tgz	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
			[ 2.8M gzipped, 7.2M uncompressed ]

	kern.tgz	The NetBSD/atari _VER kernel binary.  You should
	kern_hades.tgz	install the appropriate kernel for your system.
	kern_x.tgz	[ 472K gzipped, 1.01M uncompressed ]

	man.tgz		This set includes all of the manual pages for the
			binaries and other software contained in the base
			set.  Note that it does not include any of the
			manual pages that are included in the other sets. 
			[ 2.2M gzipped, 8.8M uncompressed ]

	misc.tgz	This set includes the system dictionaries (which
			are rather large), the typesettable document set,
			and man pages for other architectures which happen
			to be installed from the source tree by default. 
			[ 2.1M gzipped, 7.6M uncompressed ]

	text.tgz	This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
			including groff, all related programs, and their
			manual pages. 
			[ 1.0M gzipped, 3.7M uncompressed ]

	xbase.tgz	X clients, shared libraries, and related man pages.
			Also includes bitmaps and miscellaneous
			configuration files.
			[ 2.34 M gzipped, 7.46M uncompressed ]

	xcomp.tgz	Static libraries, include files (except bitmaps),
			X config files (for xmkmf), and related man pages.
			[ 1.57M gzipped, 6.38M uncompressed ]

	xcontrib.tgz	User-contributed X binaries (e.g. xev, xload) built
			from the X11 "contrib" sources with man pages and
			default config files.
			[ 178K gzipped, 661K uncompressed ]

	xfont.tgz	X11 fonts.
			[ 5.66M gzipped, 6.99M uncompressed ]

	[* Note: an X server distribution set is currently not available.]

The NetBSD/atari security distribution set is named "secr.tgz" and can be
found in the "atari/binary/security" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER
distribution tree.  It contains the crypt libraries (for the DES encryption
algorithm) and the binaries built from the "src/domestic" portion of the
NetBSD source tree which depend on it.  It can only be found on those sites
which carry the complete NetBSD distribution and that can legally obtain
it.  (Remember, because of United States law, it may not be legal to
distribute this set to locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
[ 779K gzipped, 2.5M uncompressed ]

The atari binary distribution sets are distributed as full .tar.gz files
(with the extension .tgz because the software used to download the sets may
incorrectly auto-unpack files ending in .gz and to accomodate systems which
only support 3 character extensions to file names).  The instructions
given for extracting the source sets work equally well for the binary sets,
but it is worth noting that if you use that method, the files are extracted
"below" the current directory.  That is, if you want to extract the
binaries "into" your system, i.e. replace the system binaries with them,
you have to run the "tar xvpf" from /.  Also note that if you upgrade or
install this way, those programs that you are using at the time will NOT be
replaced.  If you follow the normal installation or upgrade procedures,
this will be taken care of for you.

Additional kernels to those included in the distribution sets may be found
in the "atari/binary/kernel" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution
tree.  These kernels are generally named something like "netbsd.BOOT.gz"
or some other suitable name.  Please note that these kernels are simply
gzipped and are not in tar archives.

There are three atari floppy images to be found in the
"atari/installation/floppies" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER
distribution.  One of them is a bootable TOS kernel floppy and the other
two are installation floppies.  They are described in more detail below.
There are gzipped versions of each available, for easier downloading.
(The gzipped version have the ".gz" extension added to their names.)

Bootable Kernel floppy:

	This TOS disk contains the loadbsd and chg_pid programs
	and a kernel.  It is setup so that you can insert it
	int your floppy drive, and start the programs from GEM.

	For the TT030 and Falcon, the floppy is named boot-_SVER_S.fs and
	the kernel supplied is 'BOOT'. For the Hades, you need the
	hades-boot-_SVER_S.fs floppy. The kernel is 'HADES'.

Installation floppy:

	This disk contains a BSD root file system setup to help
	you install the rest of NetBSD.  This includes formatting
	and mounting your root and /usr partitions and getting
	ready to extract (and possibly first fetching) the distribution
	sets.  There is enough on this file system to allow you to
	make a slip connection, configure an ethernet, mount an NFS
	file system or ftp.  You can also load distribution sets from
	a SCSI tape or from one of your existing GEMDOS partitions.

	These floppies are named "miniroot.fs.1" and "miniroot.fs.2".

There are also TOS utilities in the "atari/installation/misc" subdirectory,
which you will need to get NetBSD/Atari 'up-and-running'.

	The "gzip.ttp" program allows you to uncompress .gz images.  The
	usage is "gzip.ttp -d filename.gz".

	The "rawwrite.ttp" program allows you to create the installation 
	floppy disks from the files in the "atari/floppies" directory.

	The "aptck.ttp" program reads the partition tables present on a
	given disk and tries to interpret then the same way the NetBSD
	kernel does.  If you have a disk on which GEMDOS and NetBSD are
	to co-exist, It is a good idea to run this before you begin the
	NetBSD/Atari installation just to check that the kernel's view
	of the partition tables agree with GEMDOS's view.  If you have
	more than 3 partitions defined on a disk you will notice that
	the NetBSD/Atari partition starts one sector after the GEMDOS
	partition.  This is to allow space for the auxilliary root for
	the 4th and subsequent partitions.

	The "loadbsd.ttp" program loads the NetBSD/Atari kernel from TOS
	(or MiNT, MultiTOS, etc.).

Note:	Each directory in the atari binary distribution also has its
-----	own checksum files, just as the source distribution does:

	All BSDSUM files are historic BSD checksums for the various files
	in that directory, in the format produced by the command:
	cksum -o 1 <file>.

	All CKSUM files are POSIX checksums for the various files in that
	directory, in the format produced by the command: cksum <file>.

	All MD5 files are MD5 digests for the various files in that
	directory, in the format produced by the command: cksum -m <file>.

	All SYSVSUM files are historic AT&T System V UNIX checksums for
	the various files in that directory, in the format produced by
	the command: cksum -o 2 <file>.

	The MD5 digest is the safest checksum, followed by the POSIX
	checksum. The other two checksums are provided only to ensure
	that the widest possible range of system can check the integrity
	of the release files.
