.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 4 MB of RAM and ~60 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended, as
.Nx
with 4 MB of RAM feels like Solaris with 4 MB of RAM - slow.
Note that until you have around 16 MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.
