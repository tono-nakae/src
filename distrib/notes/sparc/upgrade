	$NetBSD: upgrade,v 1.7 1998/01/09 18:47:27 perry Exp $	

To upgrade to NetBSD _VER from a previous version follow the instructions
in the section "Installing NetBSD", but run the script `upgrade.sh'
in stead of `install.sh'.

The upgrade script will use the existing disk partitions to install the
new system in, and also preserves the files in `/etc'.
