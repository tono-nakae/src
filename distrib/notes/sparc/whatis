.Nx \*V
is the seventh major release for the \*M.
.Pp
Some (but not all!) notable \*M-specific improvements include:
.(bullet
Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) support has finally been completed.  Support
for SuperSPARC CPU's is complete, but multi-processor hyperSPARC
systems are not yet supported.
.It
A longstanding sun4c MMU bug has been squashed.  sun4c models should be 
more stable and SPARCstation 1, SPARCstation 1+, and Sun IPC models should
run substantially faster.
.It
The release of X11 distributed with the \*M port has been upgraded from
XFree86 3.3.6 to Xfree86 4.3.0.
.It
Improvements in PCMCIA support.
.It
Support for ZX and TZX framebuffers (a.k.a leo).
.It
Support for JavaStations.
.bullet)
.Pp
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx*M
binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
