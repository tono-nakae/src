.Nx \*V
is the seventh major release for the \*M.
.Pp
Some (but not all!) notable \*M-specific improvements include:
.(bullet
Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) support has finally been completed.  Support
for Viking and SuperSPARC CPU's is complete, but multi-processor HyperSPARC
systems are not yet supported.
.It
A longstanding sun4c MMU bug has been squashed.  sun4c models should be 
more stable and SPARCstation 1, SPARCstation 1+, and Sun IPC models should
run substantially faster.
.It
The release of X11 distributed with the \*M port has been upgraded from
XFree86 3.3.6 to Xfree86 4.3.0.
.bullet)
.Pp
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx*M
binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
