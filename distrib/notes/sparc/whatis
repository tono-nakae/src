Some (but not all!) notable \*M-specific improvements include:

Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) support has finally been completed.  
Most SuperSPARC-I, SuperSPARC-II, and hyperSPARC CPU modules will work 
properly in SMP models.

A longstanding sun4c MMU bug has been squashed.  sun4c models should be 
more stable and SPARCstation 1, SPARCstation 1+, and Sun IPC models should
run substantially faster.

The release of X11 distributed with the \*M port has been upgraded from
XFree86 3.3.6 to Xfree86 4.4.0.
.It

Support for ZX and TZX framebuffers (a.k.a leo).
.It
Support for JavaStations.

.Pp
.Nx \*V
on \*M is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx*M
binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
