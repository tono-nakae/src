First and foremost, before beginning the installation process,
.Em make sure you have a reliable backup
of any data on your Windows CE memory and settings that you
wish to keep.
Sadly, there is no freely available program to accomplish this task,
so you must use ActiveSync or another commercially available program to
backup your Windows CE machine before installing NetBSD/hpcmips.
