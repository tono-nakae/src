.\" This is the first public release of NetBSD/hpcmips.
This is the snapshot release of NetBSD/hpcmips.
.Pp
NetBSD/hpcmips brings the
NetBSD operating system to
MIPS based Windows CE PDA machines.  Currently, the 
Vr4102, Vr4111, Vr4121, Vr4181, TX3912, and TX3922 processors are supported.
.Pp
The port name "hpcmips" comes from the name for some of the hardware
that NetBSD/hpcmips runs on: MIPS based systems in Microsoft's
H/PC (Handheld PC) form factor.
The palm sized units are also supported, but lack an input method.
