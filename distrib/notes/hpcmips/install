boot with `pbsdboot.exe' and `netbsd' in `installation' directory.
`sysinst' will automatically start. 

The NetBSD/hpcmips kernel and system install consume about 6MB of memory.
Please configure the Windows CE memory setting to allow this amount of
memory to be used.  If you failed pbsdboot.exe with "cannot allocate heap"
error, configure more RAM for memory and less for disk with the dialog at
[Setting]->[ControlPanel]->[System]->[Memory] under Windows CE.
