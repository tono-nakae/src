As is usual between releases, the i386 port has had many improvements
made to it - too many to detail all of them here.
.Pp
Numerous new drivers have been added. See the supported hardware list
for details.

Some (but not all!) notable i386-specific improvements include:
.(bullet
Migration to the ELF binary format from a.out.
.It
Preliminary support for MCA (MicroChannel Architecture)
.bullet)
.Nx \*V
on i386 is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old

i386 binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs
provided you set the appropriate binary compatibility options in your
kernel configuration.
