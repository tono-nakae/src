.Nx*M
\*V runs on PCI-based Power Macs and several compatibles.
The minimal configuration requires 4 MB of RAM and ~80 MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended, as
.Nx with 4 MB of RAM is very slow. Note that until you have
around 16 MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.
