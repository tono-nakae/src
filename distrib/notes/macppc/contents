The macppc-specific portion of the NetBSD _VER release is found in the
"macppc" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../NetBSD-_VER/macppc/

	INSTALL			Installation notes (this file);

	binary/
		sets/		macppc binary distribution sets;
				see below.

		security/	macppc security distribution; see below.

		kernel/		Base GENERIC kernels;

	installation/

		floppy/		macppc boot and installation floppies;
				see below.

The NetBSD/macppc binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the NetBSD _VER release for the macppc.  There are seven binary
distribution sets, and the "security" distribution set.  The binary
distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the "macppc/binary"
subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution tree, and are as follows:

	base	The NetBSD/macppc _VER base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base NetBSD utilities that are necessary for the system
		to run and be minimally functional.  It includes shared
		library support, and excludes everything described below.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	comp	The NetBSD/macppc Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, Objective C, and FORTRAN (yes, there
		are two, although NO FORTRAN compiler!).  This set
		includes the system include files (/usr/include), the
		linker, the compiler tool chain, and the various system
		libraries (except the shared libraries, which are
		included as part of the base set).  This set also
		includes the manual pages for all of the utilities it
		contains, as well as the system call and library manual
		pages.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	etc	This distribution set contains the system configuration
		files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
		This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	games	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	man	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	misc	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and manual
		pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	text	This set includes NetBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	xbase	This set includes X11R6.3 programs, libraries and manual
		pages.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	xcomp	This set includes X11R6.3 header files, static libraries
		and manual pages needed to compile X Window programs.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	xcontrib This set is the X11R6.3 contributed software collection,
		made up from programs in the contrib distribution.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	xfont	This set contains the X11R6.3 fonts.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]

	xserver	This set contains X Windows server programs and
		accompanying manual pages.
		[ XXX gzipped, XXX uncompressed ]


The macppc security distribution set is named "secr" and can be found
in the "macppc/security" subdirectory of the NetBSD _VER distribution
tree.  It contains crypt.c (the source file for the DES encryption
algorithm) and the binaries which depend on it.  It can only be found
on those sites which carry the complete NetBSD distribution and that
can legally obtain it.  (Remember, because of United States law, it
may not be legal to distribute this set to locations outside of the
United States and Canada.)  [ 127K gzipped, 337K uncompressed ]

The macppc binary distribution sets are distributed in the same form as
the source distribution sets; catted together, the members of a set
form a gzipped tar file.  Each macppc binary distribution set also has
its own "CKSUMS" file, just as the source distribution sets do.  The
binary sets are "rooted" at /, that is, if you want to extract the
binaries "into" your system, i.e.  replace the system binaries with
them, you have to run the "tar xfp" from /.
