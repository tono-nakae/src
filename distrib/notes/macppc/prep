.(Note
Currently
.Nx
\*V
requires a dedicated drive when you install it for the first time.  In other
words,
.Nx
\*V
cannot be installed on the hard drive on which MacOS and/or any other oparating
systems reside.  This is because of
.Nx
\*V
currently does not support Apple's Disk Partition Map.

Before you start, you must choose an installation method.  If your machine has
an on-borad Ethernet and you have the connection to an NFS server that can
provide even ~30M for a diskless-root filesystem, then installation via the net
is best.  Next best, if you have another machine that is running unix-like
operating system and has two disk drives (or one, if you live dangerously), is
to copy a diskimage onto one drive.  Finally, you can install by using a second
machine as a helper to prepare a bootable
.Nx
\*V
disk.  If you have only one machine, you can still use floppy to install
.Nx
onto your machine.
.Pp
If your target is going to run diskless, then installation proceeds as for
method 1.
.(Note
Unfortunately, since iMac lacks to support to boot an operating system other
than MacOS from its local hard drive, you must choose the method when your
target is iMac.
.Note)
.Pp
The
.Nx
uses the standard sysinst installation utility.  You should examine the guide
on the
.Nx
