.Nx \*V
is the fourth 
.Dq real
release of
.Nx
for the 68k-based Macintosh.
.Pp
For the mac68k port,
.Nx \*V
brings a number of improvements:
.Bl -bullet
.It
A host of new drivers and kernel changes enable support for
many 68040-based Macintosh systems.
.It
Many previously unsupported 68030-based Macintoshes are now working.
.It
Support for SONIC (DP83932) and MACE (Am79C940) Ethernet controllers
has been added (via the "sn" and "mc" devices).
.It
The 
.Xr mac68k/ae 4
driver for DP8390-based Ethernet cards now handles more
NuBus ethernet cards.
.It
The
.Xr mac68k/grf 4
video driver supports many more NuBus video cards and
most onboard video configurations.
.It
The serial driver code has been converted to use the machine
independent driver. This change enables the use of cdtrcts flow
control, but support for externally clocked serial ports is still
incomplete.
.It
The
.Xr mac68k/adb 4
driver now supports the ADB hardware on most Mac models,
and a wider variety of third party mice and trackballs are handled
as well.
.El
There is still a lot of work to be done and help is welcomed. Please jump in!
.Nx \*V
on mac68k is, as usual, also fully backward compatible with old
.Nx
mac68k binaries, so you don't need to recompile all of your local programs.
