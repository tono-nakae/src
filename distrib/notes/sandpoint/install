.Ss2 Prepare the NFS server
.
Set up an NFS server and copy the install kernel renamed into
.Pa netbsd
to its root partition.
.
.Ss2 Booting the installer
Depending whether the serial console is attached to the first or the
second UART you will have to boot
.Pa netbsd-INSTALL
(1st UART at 0x4500)
or
.Pa netbsd-INSTALL_KURO
(2nd UART at 0x4600).
KuroBox and LinkStation systems are known to have the console on the
second UART.
.Pp
Now boot the kernel by running
.Pa altboot .
The installation kernel will run
.Pa sysinst
from an internal memory disk image.
.
.so ../common/sysinst
