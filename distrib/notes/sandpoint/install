Set up an NFS server and copy the install kernel renamed into
.Pa netbsd
to its root partition.

.Ss2 Booting the installer
Depending whether the serial console is attached to the first or the
second UART you will have to boot
.Pa netbsd-INSTALL
(1st UART at 0x4500)
or
.Pa netbsd-INSTALL_KURO
(2nd UART at 0x4600).
KuroBox and LinkStation systems are known to have the console on the
second UART.
.Pp
Now boot the kernel by running netboot.
The installation kernel will run
.Pa sysinst
from an internal memory disk image.
.
.so ../common/sysinst
