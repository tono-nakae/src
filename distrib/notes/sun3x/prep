Sun3x machines usually need little or no preparation before installing
.Nx ,
other than the usual, well advised precaution of BACKING UP
ALL DATA on any attached storage devices.
.Pp
You will need to know the SCSI target ID of the drive on which you
will install
.Nx .
.(Note
SunOS/sun3x uses confusing names for
the SCSI devcies: target 1 is sd2, target 2 is sd4, etc.
.Note)

It might be a good time to run the diagnostics on your Sun3x.
The diagnostic switch forces all diagnostic information to be printed
to the ttya serial port, so it is a good idea to first attach a terminal
to it before proceeding.

The Sun3x ROM monitor can be configured to use any number of different
devices as the system console.
.Nx
will use these settings as
well, so it is important to insure that they are correct. The
device used can be changed by editing the contents of the EEPROM
variable located at address 0x1F. To do so, use the command
.Ic q 1f .
You will be prompted for a new value, which you can pick from
below, or you can keep the current one by entering a period or blank
line.
