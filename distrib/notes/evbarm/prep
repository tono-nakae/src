First and foremost, before beginning the installation process,
.Em make sure you have a reliable backup
of any data on the target system that you wish to keep.  Mistakes in
e.g. partitioning your hard disk may lead to data loss.

.Ss2 Preparation for the Intel IQ80310
The IQ80310 uses RedBoot firmware from Red Hat, Inc.  RedBoot
supports loading the kernel via the serial port and the on-board
Ethernet.  These notes assume that the Ethernet will be used to
load the kernel.  RedBoot uses the Trivial File Transfer Protocol
(TFTP) to load the kernel via the network.
.Pp
These notes also assume that the IQ80310 will be run as a diskless
system; that an NFS server will provide the root file system.  The
.Nx
kernel uses the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to
obtain network address and root file system information.
.Pp
The first step is to configure your DHCP, NFS, and TFTP server
software.  You will need the MAC address for the on-board Ethernet,
which RedBoot can provide; see the RedBoot documentation for more
information.
.Pp
The next step is to configure RedBoot to obtain its IP address from
your DHCP server; see the RedBoot documentation for more information.
.Pp
Once your DHCP server and RedBoot are properly configured, you should
see information similar to the following when the IQ80310 is reset
or powered-up:
