.Pp
NetBSD/arm26 \*V should support all common Acorn machines fitted with
ARM2, ARM3 and ARM250 CPUs.  This includes all Archimedes systems except
for the A500 and A680 prototypes, all R-series workstations, the BBC A3000,
the A5000, A4, A3010, A3020 and A4000.
.Pp
NetBSD/arm26 currently requires exactly eight megabytes of RAM to work.
Four-megabyte systems should work, but tend to run out of memory very easily.
.Pp
NetBSD/arm26 supports a subset of the on-board I/O systems on these machines.
The on-board video system is supported, as are the standard keyboard and
mouse.  Other on-board device support differs between two classes of machine:
.Bl -tag -width 5em
.It "Old machines (Archimedes, R-series and BBC A3000)"
None of the other on-board devices are supported.
.It "New machines (A5000, A4, A3010, A3020 and A4000)"
The on-board IDE controller, serial port and parallel port are believed to
be supported, but this support is mostly untested.

.Pp
NetBSD/arm26 supports a few Expansion Cards (otherwise known as "podules").
At present, the following are known to work:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Acorn AKA25 Ethernet (Ether1) (ei)
.It
Atomwide Ethernet III (Ether3) (ea)
.El
.Pp
NetBSD/arm26 uses the machine's ROM OS to boot, and hence depends slightly on
it.  It's been tested with RISC OS 3.10 and RISC OS 3.11, and should work
with other versions of RISC OS as well.  It hasn't been tested with Arthur at
all.
