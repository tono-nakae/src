The preferred upgrade path is to set up a diskless-boot host, unpack
and boot the \*V diskimage as for a network installation, and to use
the sysinst tool to upgrade your system.   Please see the
.Sx Installation
section for  further information.
.
.Ss2 Upgrade via diskimage.
.
If you cannot netboot, the recommended path is to upgrade by booting a
diskimage from your swap partition.  Pmaxes cannot boot out out of
anything but the
.Ic a
partition. However, you
.Em can No boot an upgrade
kernel off your
.Ic a
partition and tell that kernel to use your
.Ic b
partition as its root.  The steps to do this
(after you've  fetched the diskimage) with a current root of rzX are:
.Bl -enum
.It
Boot single-user from your current root, rzX.
.No \&Be Em sure
not to start swapping:
.D1 \*>\*> Ic "boot -f rz(0,X,0)netbsd -s      # 3100
.D1 \*>\*> Ic "boot 5/rzX/netbsd -s            # 5000/200
.D1 \*>\*> Ic "boot 3/rzX/netbsd -s            # others
.(Note
replace the X with the unit number of your disk:
boot 3/rz2/netbsd to boot drive 2 on a 5000/xxx.
.Note)
.It
When you get a single-user prompt,  remount the
root filesystem read-write. (You wil need to update the
kernel soon.)
.D1 # Ic mount /
Then mount the filesystem with the diskimage, and
uncompress and dd the diskimage into swap (b) partition.
You will also need /usr mounted to run gunzip:
.D1 # Ic mount\ /usr
.D1 # Sy "gunzip -c diskimage.gz | dd bs=10240 of=/dev/rrzXb
.It
Mount swap (b) partition readonly on /mnt:
.D1 # Ic "mount -r -t ffs /dev/rzXb /mnt
.It
Copy  the kernel from the B partition to your root:
.D1 # Ic "cp -p  /mnt/netbsd /netbsd-1.3
(this is important; you want the kernel in / and  swap
to be a release kernel, or the release binaries will not work.)
.It
halt:
.D1 # Ic halt
.It
Reboot with an argument of "n", telling the kernel to
ask what device to use as  root:
.D1 \*>\*> Ic " boot -f rz(0,X,0)netbsd-1.3 n   # 3100
.D1 \*>\*> Ic " boot 5/rzX/netbsd-1.3 n         # 5000/200
.D1 \*>\*> Ic " boot 3/rzX/netbsd-1.3 n         # others
.(Note
.No The Ic n
after the kernel name is a literal
.Ic n ,
not the disk unit number or partition. 
It is an argument telling the kernel to ask for a root device.
.Note)
.(Note
Replace the X with the unit number of your disk:
.Ic boot 3/rz2/netbsd
to boot drive 2 on a 5000/xxx.
.Note)
.It
The
.Ic n
argument tells the kernel to prompt you for
the  root device, dump device, and root fileysystem type.
Enter when the kernel asks for
.Dl Root device:
Tell it
.Ic rz Ar X Ns b ,
.No where Ar X
is the same disk unit as in step 6.
Here's an example, again assuming drive  2 as in step 6:
.Dl KN03-AA V5.2b    (PC: 0x80051f1c, SP: 0xffffdeb0)
.Dl \*>\*> boot 3/rz2/netbsd n
.Dl boot device: rz2
.Dl root device (default rz2a): Ic rz2b
.Dl dump device (default rz2b): Ic none
.Dl file system (default generic): Ic ffs
.Dl root on rz2b
.El
Then, continue from the
.Sx Once you've booted the diskimage
step of the Installation instructions.
