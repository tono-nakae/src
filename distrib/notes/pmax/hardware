NetBSD/pmax \*V runs on the following classes of machines:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Decstation 2100 and 3100, also known as
.Em pmin No and Em pmax
.It
Personal Decstations (5000/20, and /25) also known as
.Em MAXINE
.It
Decstation 5000/120, /125, and /133, also known as
.Em 3MIN
.It
Decstation 5000/200, also known as
.Em 3MAX
.It
Decstation 5000/240, also known as
.Em 3MAXPLUS
.It
Decstation 5000/50, 5000/150 and 5000/260 \- R4000 and R4400
variants of the the
.Em MAXINE, 3MIN No and Em 3MAXPLUS
.El
.Pp
NetBSD/pmax \*V does
.Em not
(yet) run on these machines:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Decstation 5100 (an r3000-based cousin of the Decstation 3100)
.It
Decsystem 5400 and 5500 (Qbus-based systems, similar to the Vax
.Em Mayfair No \&or Em Mayfair II ,
but with an r2000a or r3000 cpu instead of a CVAX cpu.)
.It
Decsystem 5800 (xbi-based multiprocessor, a Vax 6200 with
Vax CPU boards replaced with Mips cpu boards)
.El
.Pp
The minimal configuration requires 8M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (NetBSD with 8M of
RAM feels like Ultrix with 8M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.

Supported devices include:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Decstation 2100 and 3100 baseboard video
.	Bl -hyphen -compact
.	It
one-bit mono or 8-bit pseudocolour frame buffers.
.	El
.It
Decstation 5000 series TurboChannel video
.	Bl -hyphen -compact
.	It
PMAG-DV Personal Decstation baseboard 1024x768 frame buffer
.	It
PMAG-BA 1024x768 8-bit colour frame buffer
.	It
PMAGB-BA 1024x768 8-bit colour frame buffer
.	It
PMAG-AA 1280x1024 four-bit greyscale frame buffer
.		(Note
All supported DECstation video produces sync-on-green.
Be sure to use either a DEC-compatible fixed-sync monitor
or a multisync monitor that supports sync-on-green.

Hardware the we do
.Em not
currently support, but get questions about from time to time:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Q-bus Decsystem machines
.It
Decstation 5100 machines
.It
PrestoServe NVRAM on Decstation 5100 and 5000/2xx machines
.It
audio drivers for Personal Decstation machines
.It
floppy driver for Personal Decstation machines
.It
TurboChannel audio hardware (LoFi)
.It
PMAG-C 2-D accelerated framebuffers with onboard i860 processors
.El
.(Note
the primary obstacle to support of all but the very
last item is non-availability of sample hardware for development.
.Pp
The primary obstacle for the i860-based framebuffers is that there
is no documentation on the accelerator board.
