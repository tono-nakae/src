~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[Section to be written.]

IMPORTED VERSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following software is in gnusrc/gnu/dist/toolchain, in a unified build
structure:

    gcc-2.95.3
    binutils-2.11.2
    gdb-5.0


IMPORT STEPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. All distributions were unpacked and all `.cvsignore' files were
   removed.

2. All files in gcc's `include' top level directory were removed from
   binutils's `include' top level directory (these are the libiberty
   include files).

   cd gcc-*/include; for f in *; do rm -f ../../binutils-*/include/$f; done

3. The gcc distribution was imported in one shot into
   gnusrc/gnu/dist/toolchain, including the recursive build structure.

4. The binutils distribution was stripped down to the following directories,
   with no files at the top level:

   bfd, binutils, gas, gprof, include, intl, ld, opcodes

5. Binutils was imported into gnusrc/gnu/dist/toolchain, which included
   only the subdirectories above.

6. The gdb distribution was stripped down to the following directories,
   with no files at the top level:

   gdb, mmalloc, readline, sim

7. Gdb was imported into gnusrc/gnu/dist/toolchain, which included only
   the subdirectories above.
