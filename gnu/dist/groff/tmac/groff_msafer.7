.TH GROFF_MSAFER 7 "April 8, 2001" "Groff Version 1.16.1"
.SH NAME
groff_msafer \- groff -msafer macros
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B groff
.B \-msafer
[
.IR options .\|.\|.
]
[
.IR files .\|.\|.
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The -msafer macros remove the
.BR open ,
.BR opena ,
.BR pso ,
.BR sy ,
and
.B pi
requests.
These macros should be used when processing input from
an untrustworthy source.
For maximum safety,
they should be the first -m option on the command-line.
Normally they are invoked using the
.B \-S
option of groff, which will also pass
.B pic
the
.B \-S
flag.
This is now the default; to get the old behaviour, use the
.B \-U
flag.
.SH FILES
.B /usr/share/tmac/tmac.safer
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR groff (1),
.BR troff (1),
.BR pic (1)
