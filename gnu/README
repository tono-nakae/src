src/gnu/README:			<$Revision: 1.1 $>

This directory hierarchy is using a new organization for
separating the "stock" GNU sources from the BSD-ized
build infrastructure.  The "stock" GNU sources are in:

	dist/*

and the above are organized exactly as they are in the
GNU project's own common source repository.  Original
sources for the above were imported as follows:

	dist/gdb	FSF gdb-4-16
	dist/readline	FSF readline-2-1
	dist/(other)	FSF binutils-2-8

The build infrastructure uses the normal BSD way under:

	lib/*
	usr.bin/*

The makefiles in the above hierarchy will "reach over"
into the stock GNU sources for everything they need.

Working notes:

Imported binutils-2.8, gdb-4.16, readline-2.1  [gwr 970924]
