# We don't want to build postfix-script (at least for now) because
# we're now treating it as a configuration file, per Wietse Venema's
# request. We now have conf/Makefile install a copy into
# share/examples/postfix, and postfix-etc/Makefile (only called by
# make distribution) installs a copy in /etc/postfix

# also not built: smtpstone (unneeded)
# and html (unsure what to do with it (yet))

# The distribution: target is invoked from the make distribution
# target in src/etc/Makefile. It is there for building the /etc/
# set. You don't want to run it normally as it would blow away your
# /etc/postfix directory.
