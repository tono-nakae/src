# Sample fstab for SCSI disk based system
# see fstab(5) for details on what the fields mean
# Notes:
# the swap entry is not strictly needed; strictly speaking, devices
# labeled "sw" are only in fstab for use by "swapon -a", and the
# first swap device is always used even without the swapon.
# /tmp is on a 10M mfs partition; see mount_mfs(8) for details
