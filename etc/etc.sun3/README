NetBSD/Sun3 Binary Snapshot

This FTP directory contains a binary snapshot of NetBSD/Sun3.

The NetBSD/sun3 port runs on most Sun3 machines, including:

	Sun3/{50,60,110,160,260}

Devices currently supported include:

	Intel Ether (ie), on-board or VME
	Lance Ether (le), on-board
	SCSI (sd,st,...), on-board or VME
	keyboard/display console
	serial port (ttya/ttyb) console

Other Features:

	Generic kernel supports root on: sd[0123], ie0, le0
	Kernel debugger included (ddb)
	Runs SunOS binaries (see sparc sun shared lib notes)

There's still a lot left to do  (see doc/sun3/TODO).

Before using the files in this directory, you should start by
unpacking doc.tar.gz and reading all the files it contains.
Suggested reading order is:
	doc/sun3/README
	doc/sun3/STATUS
	doc/sun3/INSTALL
	doc/sun3/SUP
	doc/sun3/ENVIRONMENT
	doc/sun3/BUILDING
	doc/sun3/TODO

In particular, note that most of the *.tar.gz files are actually just
copied from the Amiga snapshot (yes, same binary format) and those
that are different are replaced by unpacking zupdate.tar.gz LAST.

	Note that you MUST install zupdate.tar.gz LAST!

The script "install.sh" can help you install the files correctly.

This port was originated by Adam Glass <glass@netbsd.org>
(thanks Adam!).  Since Adam is low on free time, the port is
now being maintained by Gordon Ross <gwr@netbsd.org>.

If you have any questions or comments about this port please
send mail to the list:  <port-sun3@netbsd.org>

If you'd like to help, send me mail at <gwr@netbsd.org>
so I can coordinate efforts.

Enjoy!
