NetBSD/Sun3 Binary Snapshot

This FTP directory contains a binary snapshot of NetBSD/Sun3.
The NetBSD/sun3 port runs on Sun3 desk-top machines including:

	Sun3/60 with console on ttya or B+W screen
	Sun3/50 with console on ttya (only!)

Features:

	 Boots with root on NFS (le0) or SCSI (sd0).
	 Currently still forces single-user mode -
	   (type "exit" to go into multi-user state)
	 Runs SunOS binaries (see sparc sun shared lib notes)

There's a lot left to do... (see doc/sun3/TODO).

Before using the files in this directory, you should start by
unpacking doc.tar.gz and reading all the files it contains.
Suggested reading order is:
	doc/sun3/README
	doc/sun3/INSTALL
	doc/sun3/SUP
	doc/sun3/ENVIRONMENT
	doc/sun3/BUILDING
	doc/sun3/TODO

In particular, note that most of the *.tar.gz files are actually just
copied from the Amiga snapshot (yes, same binary format) and those
that are different are replaced by unpacking zupdate.tar.gz LAST.

	Note that you MUST install zupdate.tar.gz LAST!

The script "install.sh" can help you install the files correctly.

This port was created by Adam Glass <glass@sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu>
(thanks Adam!).  Since Adam is low on free time, the port is now
being maintained by Gordon Ross <gwr@sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu>.

If you have any questions or comments about this port please
send mail to the list:  <port-sun3@sun-lamp.cs.berkeley.edu>
rather than to any of us personally.

Enjoy!
