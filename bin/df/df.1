.Sh NAME
.Nm df
.Nd display free disk space
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm df
.Op Fl ikln
.Op Fl t Ar type
.Op Ar file | Ar file_system ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Df
displays statistics about the amount of free disk space on the specified
.Ar file_system
or on the file system of which
.Ar file
is a part.
Values are displayed in 512-byte per block block counts.
If neither a file or a
.Ar file_system
operand is specified,
statistics for all mounted file systems are displayed
(subject to the
.Fl l
and
.Fl t
options below).
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Include statistics on the number of free inodes.
.It Fl k
By default, all sizes are reported in 512-byte block counts.
The
.Fl k
option causes the numbers to be reported in kilobyte counts.
.It Fl l
Display statistics only about mounted file systems with the MNT_LOCAL
flag set.  This option is deprecated by the
.Fl t\ local
option, and may be removed in a future release.
.It Fl n
Print out the previously obtained statistics from the file systems.
This option should be used if it is possible that one or more
file systems are in a state such that they will not be able to provide
statistics without a long delay.
When this option is specified,
.Nm df
will not request new statistics from the file systems, but will respond
with the possibly stale statistics that were previously obtained.
.It Fl t
Only print out statistics for file systems of the specified types.
The follow additional types are recognized:
all (the default),
local (all file systems with the MNT_LOCAL flag set),
ro (all file systems with the MNT_RDONLY flag set),
and rw (all file systems with the MNT_RDONLY flag clear).
The string ``no'' may be prepended to a type to get its complement
(e.g. ``nonfs'' to get non-NFS file systems).  The first
.Fl t
option overrides the default, additional such options will add to
(or subtract from) the current set of types; e.g. 
``df -t ufs -t lfs''
will display statistics for UFS and LFS file systems, and
``df -t local -t nolfs''
will display statistics for all
.Dq local
file systems except LFS.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
.Bl -tag -width BLOCKSIZE
.It Ev BLOCKSIZE
If the environmental variable
.Ev BLOCKSIZE
is set, and the
.Fl k
option is not specified, the block counts will be displayed in units of that
size block.
