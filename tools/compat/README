$NetBSD: README,v 1.3 2002/04/28 22:28:38 bjh21 Exp $

Special notes for cross-hosting a NetBSD build on certain platforms.  
Only those platforms which have been tested to complete a "build.sh" run
are listed.

=====

LINUX:

* Tested on RedHat Linux 7.1 (i386).

* The gcc (and libstdc++, if needed) package must be installed, along
  with the typical system development packages (glibc-devel, etc.).

* The ncurses-devel package must be installed (for nbinfo).

* The zlib and zlib-devel packages must be installed.  This will be
  fixed in the future to include zlib in libnbcompat.

=====

NETBSD (earlier releases):

* Tested on NetBSD 1.5.2 (machine-independently).

* Should need no special setup.

=====

SOLARIS:

* Tested on Solaris/x86 8 (5.8) with gcc 2.95.2 (not yet tested with
  SUNWspro).

* $HOST_CC needs to be set properly (for gcc, it should be set to "gcc",
  otherwise the improper /usr/ucb/cc may be invoked by accident).

* The SUNWxcu4 package (containing /usr/xpg4/bin/*) must be installed.

* The SUNWzlib package (or a built version of zlib visible to $HOST_CC)
  must be installed.  This will be fixed in the future to include zlib
  in libnbcompat.

* Needs the following paths, in this order, in $PATH:

      /usr/xpg4/bin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/bin

  (/usr/ucb may optionally be placed before /usr/bin per your preference,
  but /usr/ucb *MUST NOT* be before /usr/ccs/bin or /usr/xpg4/bin!)

* Needs the "mktemp" script from src/tools/compat/scripts, made
  executable, available somewhere in $PATH.  (Solaris has no
  command-line mktemp(1).)  This may be worked around in the future.
