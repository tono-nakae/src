.Dt GETDELIM 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getdelim ,
.Nm getline
.Nd read a delimited record from a stream
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdio.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn getdelim "char ** restrict lineptr" "size_t * restrict n" "int delimiter" "FILE * restrict stream"
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn getline "char ** restrict lineptr" "size_t * restrict n" "FILE * restrict stream"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getdelim
function reads from the
.Fa stream
until it encounters a character matching the
.Fa delimiter
character, storing the input in
.Fa *lineptr .
The buffer is
.Dv NUL Ns No -terminated
and includes the delimiter.
.Pp
If
.Fa *n
is non-zero, then
.Fa *lineptr
must be pre-allocated to at least
.Fa *n
bytes.
.Fn getdelim
ensures that
.Fa *lineptr
is large enough to hold the input, updating
.Fa *n
to reflect the new size.
.Pp
.Fa delimiter
must be representable as an unsigned char, and
.Fa *lineptr
must be a
.Xr free(3) Ns No able
buffer.
.Pp
.Fa getline
is equivalent to
.Fa getdelim
with the delimiter set to the newline character.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn getdelim
and
.Fn getline
functions return the number of characters read, including the delimiter.
If no characters were read and the stream is at end-of-file, the functions
return \-1.
If an error occurs, the functions return \-1 and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh EXAMPLE
The following code fragment reads lines from a file and writes them to
standard output.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char *line = NULL;
size_t linesize = 0;
ssize_t linelen;
while ((linelen = getline(&line, &linesize, fp)) != -1)
	fwrite(line, linelen, 1, stdout);

if (ferror(fp))
	perror("getline");
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width [EOVERFLOW]
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa *lineptr
or
.Fa *n
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
.It Bq Er EOVERFLOW
More than SSIZE_MAX characters were read without encountering the delimiter.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn getdelim
and
.Fn getline
functions may also fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified in the routines
.Xr fflush 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr read 2 ,
.Xr stat 2 ,
or
.Xr realloc 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ferror 3 ,
.Xr fgets 3 ,
.Xr fopen 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn getdelim
and
.Fn getline
functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
