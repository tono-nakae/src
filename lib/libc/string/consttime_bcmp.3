.Dt CONSTTIME_BCMP 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm consttime_bcmp
.Nd compare byte strings for equality without timing leaks
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libc
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft int
.Fn consttime_bcmp "void *b1" "void *b2" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn consttime_bcmp
function compares
.Fa len
bytes of memory at
.Fa b1
and
.Fa b2
for equality, returning zero if they are identical and nonzero
otherwise.
.Pp
The time taken by
.Fn consttime_bcmp
depends on
.Fa len ,
but not on the data at
.Fa b1
or
.Fa b2 .
Thus,
.Fn consttime_bcmp
is appropriate for comparing cryptographic secrets, hashes, message
authentication codes, etc., without leaking information about them
through a timing side channel.
In crypto literature,
.Fn consttime_bcmp
is said to take
.Sq constant time ,
meaning time that does not vary depending on the data it processes.
.Pp
Note that unlike
.Xr memcmp 3 ,
.Fn consttime_bcmp
does not return a lexicographic ordering on the data at
.Fa b1
and
.Fa b2 ;
it tells only whether they are equal.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr explicit_bzero 3 ,
.Xr memcmp 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn consttime_bcmp
function appeared in
.Nx 7.0 .
