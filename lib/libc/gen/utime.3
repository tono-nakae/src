.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Ft int
.Fn utime "const char *file" "const struct utimbuf *timep"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn utime
function sets the access and modification times of the named file.
.Pp
If
.Fa timep
is
.Dv NULL ,
the access and modification times are set to the current time.
The calling process must be the owner of the file or have permission to 
write the file.
.Pp
If 
.Fa timep
is 
.Pf non- Dv NULL ,
.Fa time 
is assumed to be a pointer to a utimbuf structure, as defined in 
.Aq Pa utime.h :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct utimbuf {
	time_t actime;          /* Access time */
	time_t modtime;         /* Modification time */
} ;
.Ed
.Pp
The access time is set to the value of the actime member, and the modification
time is set to the value of the modtime member.  The times are measured in
seconds since 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds, January 1, 1970, Coordinated 
Universal Time.
