.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libform
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <form.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr form 3
provides a terminal independent form system using the 
.Xr curses 3
library.  Before using the 
.Xr menu 3
functions the terminal must be set up by
.Xr curses 3
using the
.Fn initscr
function or similar.  Programs using
.Xr form
functions must be linked with the
.Xr curses 3
library
.Xr -lcurses .
.Pp
The
.Xr form 3
library provides facilties for defining form fields, placing a form on the
terminal screen, assign pre and post change operations and setting the
attributes of both the form and it's fields.
.Sh Defining default attributes for forms and fields
The
.Xr form 3
library allows any settable attribute or option of both the form and field
objects to be defined such that any new form or field automatically inherits
the value as default.  Setting the default value will not affect any field or
form that has already been created but will be applied to subsequent objects.
To set the default attribute or option the set routine is passed a NULL
pointer in the field or form parameter when calling the set routine.  The
current default value can be retrieved by calling the get routine with a
NULL pointer for the field or form parameter.
