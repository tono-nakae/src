.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <machine/sysarch.h>
.Fd #include <machine/mtrr.h>
.Ft int
.Fn i386_get_mtrr "struct mtrr *mtrrp" "int *n"
.Ft int
.Fn i386_set_mtrr "struct mtrr *mtrrp" "int *n"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions provide an interface to the MTRR registers found on
686-class processors.
.Pp
The argument
.Fa mtrrp
has the following structure:
.Bd -literal
struct mtrr {
        uint64_t base;
        uint64_t len;
        uint8_t type;
        int flags;
        pid_t owner;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The location of the mapping is described by its base address
.Em base
and length
.Em len .
Valid values for
.Em type
are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width MTRR_TYPE_UNDEF1 -compact
.It MTRR_TYPE_UC
.It MTRR_TYPE_WC
.It MTRR_TYPE_UNDEF1
.It MTRR_TYPE_UNDEF2
.It MTRR_TYPE_WT
.It MTRR_TYPE_WP
.It MTRR_TYPE_WB
.El
.Pp
Valid values for
.Em flags
are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width MTRR_PRIVATE -compact
.It MTRR_PRIVATE
own range, reset at exit
.It MTRR_FIXED
use fixed range MTRR
.It MTRR_VALID
entry is valid
.El
.Pp
The
.Em owner
member the PID of the user process which claims the mapping.  It is
only valid if MTRR_PRIVATE is set in
.Em flags .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion zero is returned, otherwise -1 is returned
on failure.
