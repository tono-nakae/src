.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em IMPORTANT NOTE!
This document describes interfaces which are not yet guaranteed to be
stable.
In case you update your system sources, please recompile everything
and fix complation errors.
If your sources are out-of-sync, incorrect operation may result.
The interfaces in this document will most likely be hugely simplified
in later versions or made transparent to the implementation.
.Pp
It should especially be noted, that it is yet completely unsure, how
much of the internals contents of
.Vt struct puffs_node
will be exposed to file systems in the end.
.Pp
Nodes are allocated and released by using
.Fn puffs_pn_new
and
.Fn puffs_pn_put ,
respectively.
The argument
.Fa priv
can be used to store file system specific information.
.Pp
The list of all nodes in a file system can be traversed by calling
.Fn puffs_pn_nodewalk .
This is useful for example in handling the
.Fn puffs_fs_sync
callback, when cached data for every node should be flushed to stable
storage.
