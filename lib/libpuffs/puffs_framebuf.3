.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em IMPORTANT NOTE!
This document describes interfaces which are not yet guaranteed to be
stable.
In case you update your system sources, please recompile everything
and fix complation errors.
If your sources are out-of-sync, incorrect operation may result.
The interfaces in this document will most likely be hugely simplified
in later versions or made transparent to the implementation.
.Pp
Under construction.
