.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em IMPORTANT NOTE!
This document describes interfaces which are not yet guaranteed to be
stable.
In case you update your system sources, please recompile everything
and fix complation errors.
If your sources are out-of-sync, incorrect operation may result.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines provide buffering and an event loop structured around the
buffers.
It operates on top of the puffs continuation framework,
.Xr puffs_cc 3 ,
and multiplexes execution automatically to an instance whenever
one is runnable.
Currently only request-response type "client pull" protocols are
supported, but support for protocols which also feature "server
push" type messaging may be added at a later date.
.Pp
The file system is entered in two different ways:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
An event arrives from the kernel and the
.Xr puffs_ops 3
callbacks are called to start processing the event.
.It
A file system which has sent out a request receives a response.
Execution is resumed from the place where the file system yielded.
.El
.Pp
For a file server to use
.Nm ,
it must implemented three different routines:
.Bl -tag -width "xcmpfbx"
.It rfb
Read a frame onto the specified buffer.
.It wfb
Write a frame from the specified buffer.
.It cmpfb
Identify if a buffer is the response to the specified buffer.
.El
.Pp
Additionally, a fourth optional one called
.Fn lfn
may be specified.
It will be called from the event loop once per loop (please note that
"once per loop" is not a well-defined interval, but rather it should be
considered as a synonym for "occasionally").
It can be used to control information such as a requirement to
unmount the file system.
.Pp
The buffers of
.Nm
provide automatic memory management of buffers for the file servers.
They provide a cursor to the current buffer offset.
Reading or writing data through the normal routines will advance that cursor.
Additionally, the buffer size is provided to the user.
It represents the maximum offset where data was written.
.Pp
Generally the write functions will fail if the cannot allocate enough
memory to satisfy the buffer length requirements.
Read functions will fail if the amount of data written to the buffer
is not large enough to satisfy the read.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_make
Create a buffer.
Return the address of the buffer or
.Dv NULL
in case no memory was available.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_destroy pufbuf
Free memory used by buffer.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_recycle pufbuf
Reset offsets so that buffer can be reused.
Does not free memory or reallocate memory.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_reserver_space pufbuf space
Make sure that the buffer has
.Ar space
bytes of available memory starting from the current offset.
This is not strictly necessary, but can be used for optimizations
where it is known in advance how much memory will be required.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_putdata pufbuf data dlen
Write
.Ar dlen
amount of data from the address
.Ar data
into the buffer.
Moves the offset cursor forward
.Ar dlen
bytes.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_putdata_atoff pufbuf offset data dlen
Like
.Fn puffs_framebuf_putdata ,
except writes data at buffer offset
.Ar offset .
It is legal to write past the current end of the buffer.
Does NOT modify the current offset cursor.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_getdata pufbuf data dlen
Read
.Ar dlen
bytes of data from the buffer into
.Ar data .
Advances the offset cursor.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_getdata_atoff pufbuf offset data dlen 
Read data from buffer position
.Ar offset .
Does NOT modify the offset cursor.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_telloff pufbuf
Return the offset into the buffer.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_tellsize pufbuf
Return the maximum offset where data has been written, i.e. buffer size.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_remaining pufbuf
Distance from current offset to the end of the buffer, i.e. size-offset.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_seekset pufbuf offset
Set the offset cursor to the position
.Ar offset .
This does NOT modify the buffer size, but reserves at least
enough memory memory for a write to
.Ar offset
and will fail if memory cannot be allocated.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_getwindow pufbuf offset winp winlen
Get a direct memory window into the buffer starting from
.Ar offset .
The maximum mapped window size will be
.Ar winlen
bytes, but this routine might return a smaller window and the caller
should always check the actual mapped size after the call.
The window is returned in
.Ar winp .
This function not modify the buffer offset, but it DOES set the buffer
size to
.Ar offset +
.Ar winlen
in case that value is greater than the current size.
The window is valid until the next until the next
.Fn puffs_framebuf
call operating on the buffer in question.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_enqueue_cc pcc pufbuf
Add the buffer
.Ar pufbuf
to outgoing queue and yield with the continuation
.Ar pcc .
Execution is resumed once a response is received.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_cb pu pufbuf arg
Callback function.
Called when a response to a specific request arrives from the server.
May not block.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_enqueue_cb pu pufbuf fcb fcb_arg
Enqueue the buffer
.Ar pufbuf
for outgoing data and immediately return.
Once a response arrives, the callback
.Fn fcb
will be called with the argument
.Ar fcb_arg .
The callback function
.Fn fcb
is responsible for freeing the buffer.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_enqueue_justsend pu pufbuf waitreply
Enqueue the buffer
.Ar pufbuf
for outgoing traffic and immediately return.
The parameter
.Ar waitreply
can be used to control if the buffer is to be freed immediately after
sending of if a response is expected and the buffer should be freed
only after the response arrives (receiving an unexpected message from
the server is treated as an error).
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_readframe_fn pu pufbuf fd done
Callback function.
Read at most one frame from file descriptor
.Ar fd
into the buffer
.Ar pufbuf.
If a complete frame is read, the value pointed to by
.Ar done
must be set to 1.
This function should return 0 on success (even if a complete frame was not
yet read) and a non-zero
.Er errno
to signal a fatal error.
This routine will be called with the same buffer argument until a
complete frame has been read.
May not block.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_writeframe_fn pu pufbuf fd done
Write the frame contained in
.Ar pufbuf
to the file descriptor
.Ar fd .
In case the entire frame is succesfully written,
.Ar *done
should be set to 1.
This function should return 0 on success (even if a complete frame was not
yet written) and a non-zero
.Er errno
to signal a fatal error.
This routine will be called with the same buffer argument until the
complete frame has been written.
May not block.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_respcmp_fn pu pufbuf_cmp1 pufbuf_cmp2
Compare if
.Ar pufbuf_cmp1
is the response to the message in
.Ar pufbuf_cmp2 .
Should return 1 if true, 0 if false.
May not block.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_loop_fn pu
If supplied, called once every loop.
The file system is free to do any processing it sees necessary.
May not block.
.It Fn puffs_framebuf_eventloop pu fd rfb wfb cmpfb lfn
Enter event loop and start processing requests from the kernel and
file system backend.
This returns either when a fatal error occurs or when the file system
is unmounted.
