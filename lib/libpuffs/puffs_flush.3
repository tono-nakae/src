.Sh NAME
.Nm puffs_flush
.Nd puffs kernel cache flushing and invalidation routines
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libpuffs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In puffs.h
.Ft int
.Fn puffs_inval_namecache_dir "struct puffs_usermount *pu" "void *cookie"
.Ft int
.Fn puffs_inval_namecache_all "struct puffs_usermount *pu"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em IMPORTANT NOTE!
This document describes interfaces which are not yet guaranteed to be
stable.
In case you update your system sources, please recompile everything
and fix complation errors.
If your sources are out-of-sync, incorrect operation may result.
The interfaces in this document will most likely be hugely simplified
in later versions or made transparent to the implementation.
.Pp
These routines are used inform the kernel that any information it might
have cached is no longer valid.
Currently only two are supported.
.Fn puffs_inval_namecache_dir
invalidates the name cache for a given directory.
The argument
.Va cookie
should describe an existing and valid directory cookie for the file
system.
Similarly,
.Fn puffs_inval_namecache_all
invalidates the name cache for the entire file system
(this routine might go away).
