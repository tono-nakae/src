/*
 * A window an array of __LINE structures pointed to by the 'lines' pointer.
 * A line is an array of __LDATA structures pointed to by the 'line' pointer.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the __LDATA structure must NOT induce any padding, so if new
 * fields are added -- padding fields with *constant values* should ensure
 * that the compiler will not generate any padding when storing an array of
 *  __LDATA structures.  This is to enable consistent use of memcmp, and memcpy
 * for comparing and copying arrays.
