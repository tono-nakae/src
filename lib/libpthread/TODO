$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.12 2007/11/13 17:20:09 ad Exp $

Bugs to fix:

- Add locking to ld.elf_so so that multiple threads doing lazy binding
  doesn't trash things.

Interfaces/features to implement:

- Realtime exensions: priority scheduling, priority inheritance.

- Figure out how to use registers reserved in the ABI to implement
  pthread_self(). This will allow for assembly lock stubs.

- Allow threads to change their stack size. This probably depends on the
  above item.

- Keep a pool of dead LWPs so that we do not have take the full hit of
  _lwp_create() every time pthread_create() is called.
