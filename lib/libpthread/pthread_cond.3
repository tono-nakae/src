.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_cond_init
function creates a new condition variable, with attributes specified with
.Fa attr .
If
.Fa attr
is
.Dv NULL
the default attributes are used.
.Pp
Condition variables are intended to be used to communicate changes in
the state of data shared between threads.
Condition variables are always associated with a mutex to provide
synchronized access to the shared data.
A single predicate should always be associated with a
condition variable.
The predicate should identify a state of the
shared data that must be true before the thread proceeds.
.Pp
The macro
.Dv PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER
can be used to initialize a condition variable when it can be statically
allocated and the default attributes are appropriate.
The effect is similar to calling
.Fn pthread_cond_init
with
.Fa attr
specified as
.Dv NULL ,
except that no error checking is done.
.Pp
.\" -----
The
.Fn pthread_cond_destroy
function frees the resources allocated by the condition variable
.Fa cond .
.Pp
.\" -----
The
.Fn pthread_cond_broadcast
function unblocks all threads waiting for the condition variable
.Fa cond .
If no threads are waiting on
.Fa cond ,
the
.Fn pthread_cond_broadcast
function has no effect.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_cond_signal
function unblocks one thread waiting for the condition variable
.Fa cond .
If no threads are waiting on
.Fa cond ,
the
.Fn pthread_cond_signal
function has no effect.
.Pp
When calling
.Fn pthread_cond_wait
and/or
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait ,
a temporary binding is established between the condition variable
.Fa cond
and a caller-supplied mutex.
.Pp
The same mutex must be held while calling
.Fn pthread_cond_broadcast
and
.Fn pthread_cond_signal .
Neither function enforces this requirement, but if the mutex is not
held the resulting behaviour is undefined.
.Pp
.\" -----
The
.Fn pthread_cond_wait
function atomically blocks the current thread waiting on the condition
variable specified by
.Fa cond ,
and unlocks the mutex specified by
.Fa mutex .
The waiting thread unblocks after another thread calls
.Xr pthread_cond_signal 3 ,
or
.Xr pthread_cond_broadcast 3
with the same condition variable.
The current thread holds the lock on
.Fa mutex
upon return from the
.Fn pthread_cond_wait
call.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait
function atomically blocks the current thread waiting on the condition
variable specified by
.Fa cond ,
and unlocks the mutex specified by
.Fa mutex .
The waiting thread unblocks after another thread calls
.Xr pthread_cond_signal 3 ,
or
.Xr pthread_cond_broadcast 3
with the same condition variable, or if the system time reaches the
time specified in
.Fa abstime ,
represented as
.Em struct timespec
(see
.Xr timespec 3 ) .
.Pp
Note that a call to
.Fn pthread_cond_wait
or
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait
may wake up spontaneously, without a call to
.Xr pthread_cond_signal 3
or
.Xr pthread_cond_broadcast 3 .
The caller should prepare for this by invoking
.Fn pthread_cond_wait
or
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait
within a predicate loop that tests whether the thread should proceed.
.Pp
When calling
.Fn pthread_cond_wait
or
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait ,
a temporary binding is established between the condition variable
.Fa cond
and the mutex
.Fa mutex .
.Pp
The same mutex must be held while calling
.Fn pthread_cond_broadcast
and
.Fn pthread_cond_signal
on
.Fa cond .
Additionally, the same mutex must be used for concurrent calls to
.Fn pthread_cond_wait
and
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait .
Only when a condition variable is known to be quiescent may an application
change the mutex associated with it.
In this implementation, none of the functions enforce this requirement, but
if the mutex is not held or independent mutexes are used the resulting
behaviour is undefined.
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_cond_init
function will return zero and put the new condition variable id into
.Fa cond ,
otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
.Pp
.\" -----
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_cond_destroy ,
.Fn pthread_cond_signal ,
.Fn pthread_cond_broadcast ,
.Fn pthread_cond_wait
and
.Fn pthread_cond_timedwait
will return zero, otherwise an error number will be returned to
indicate the error.
