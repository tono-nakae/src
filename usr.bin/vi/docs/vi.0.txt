     VVii is a screen oriented text editor.  EExx is a line-oriented text editor.
     EExx and vvii are different interfaces to the same program, and it is possi-
     ble to switch back and forth during an edit session.  VViieeww is the equiva-
     lent of using the --RR (read-only) option of vvii.

     This manual page is the one provided with the nneexx//nnvvii versions of the
     eexx//vvii text editors.  NNeexx//nnvvii are intended as bug-for-bug compatible re-
     placements for the original Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution (4BSD)
     eexx and vvii programs.  For the rest of this manual page, nneexx//nnvvii is used
     only when it's necessary to distinguish it from the historic implementa-
     tions of eexx//vvii.

     This manual page is intended for users already familiar with eexx//vvii. Any-
     one else should almost certainly read a good tutorial on the editor be-
     fore this manual page.  If you're in an unfamiliar environment, and you
     absolutely have to get work done immediately, read the section near the
     end of this manual page, entitled FAST STARTUP.  It's probably enough to
     get you going.

     The following options are available:

     --cc      Execute _c_m_d immediately after starting the edit session.  Partic-
             ularly useful for initial positioning in the file, however _c_m_d is
             not limited to positioning commands.  This is the POSIX 1003.2
             interface for the historic ``+cmd'' syntax.  NNeexx//nnvvii supports
             both the old and new syntax.

     --ee      Start editing in ex mode, as if the command name were eexx.

     --FF      Don't copy the entire file when first starting to edit.  (The de-
             fault is to make a copy in case someone else modifies the file
             during your edit session.)

     --ll      List the files that may be recovered using the --rr option of vvii.
             This is the new interface for the historic syntax of the --rr op-
             tion without a file argument.  NNeexx//nnvvii supports both the old and
             new syntax.

     --RR      Start editing in read-only mode, as if the command name was vviieeww,
             or the readonly option was set.

     --rr      Recover the specified file.

     --ss      Enter batch mode; applicable only to eexx edit sessions.  Batch
             mode is useful when running eexx scripts.  Prompts, informative
             messages and other user oriented message are turned off, and no
             startup files or environmental variables are read.  This is the
             POSIX 1003.2 interface for the historic ``-'' argument.  NNeexx//nnvvii
             supports both the old and new syntax.

     --tt      Start editing at the specified tag.  (See ctags(1)).



     --ww      Set the initial window size to the specified number of lines.

     --vv      Start editing in vi mode, as if the command name was vvii or vviieeww.

     --xx      Reserved for X11 interfaces.  _N_o _X_1_1 _s_u_p_p_o_r_t _i_s _c_u_r_r_e_n_t_l_y
             _i_m_p_l_e_m_e_n_t_e_d_.

     EExx//vvii exit 0 on success, and greater than 0 if an error occurs.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTTAALL VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
     COLUMNS
           The number of columns on the screen.  This value overrides any sys-
           tem or terminal specific values.  If the COLUMNS environmental
           variable is not set when eexx//vvii runs, or the ccoolluummnnss option is ex-
           plicitly reset by the user, eexx//vvii enters the value into the envi-
           ronment.
     EXINIT
           A list of eexx startup commands, read if the variable NEXINIT is not
           set.
     HOME  The user's home directory, used as the initial directory path for
           the startup _$_H_O_M_E_/_._n_e_x_r_c and _$_H_O_M_E_/_._e_x_r_c files.  This value is also
           used as the default directory for the vvii ccdd command.
     LINES
           The number of rows on the screen.  This value overrides any system
           or terminal specific values.  If the LINES environmental variable
           is not set when eexx//vvii runs, or the lliinneess option is explicitly reset
           by the user, eexx//vvii enters the value into the environment.
     NEXINIT
           A list of eexx startup commands.
     SHELL
           The user's shell of choice (see also the sshheellll option).
     TERM  The user's terminal type.  The default is the type ``unknown''. If
           the TERM environmental variable is not set when eexx//vvii runs, or the
           tteerrmm option is explicitly reset by the user, eexx//vvii enters the value
           into the environment.
     TMPDIR
           The location used to stored temporary files (see also the ddiirreeccttoorryy
           option).

SSEETT OOPPTTIIOONNSS
     There are a large number of options that may be set (or unset) to change
     the editor's behavior.  This section describes the options, their abbre-
     viations and their default values.

     In each entry below, the first part of the tag line is the full name of
     the option, followed by any equivalent abbreviations.  The part in square
     brackets is the default value of the option.  Most of the options are
     boolean, i.e. they are either on or off, and do not have an associated
     value.

FFAASSTT SSTTAARRTTUUPP
     This section will tell you the minimum amount that you need to do simple
     editing tasks using vvii. If you've never used any screen editor before,
     you're likely to have problems even with this simple introduction.  In
     that case you should find someone that already knows vvii and have them
     walk you through this section.

     VVii is a screen editor.  This means that it takes up almost the entire
     screen, displaying part of the file on each screen line, except for the
     last line of the screen.  The last line of the screen is used for you to
     give commands to vvii, and for vvii to give information to you.

     The other fact that you need to understand is that vvii is a modeful edi-
     tor, i.e. you are either entering text or you are executing commands, and
     you have to be in the right mode to do one or the other.  You will be in
     command mode when you first start editing a file.  There are commands
     that switch you into input mode.  There is only one key that takes you
     out of input mode, and that is the <escape> key.  (Key names are written
     using less-than and greater-than signs, e.g.  <escape> means the
     ``escape'' key, usually labeled ``esc'' on your terminal's keyboard.)  If
     you're ever confused as to which mode you're in, keep entering the <es-
     cape> key until vvii beeps at you.  (Generally, vvii will beep at you if you
     try and do something that's not allowed.  It will also display error mes-
     sages.)

     To start editing a file, enter the command ``vi file_name<carriage-
     return>''. The command you should enter as soon as you start editing is
     ``:set verbose showmode<carriage-return>''. This will make the editor
     give you verbose error messages and display the current mode at the bot-
     tom of the screen.

     The commands to move around the file are:
     hh     Move the cursor left one character.
     jj     Move the cursor down one line.
     kk     Move the cursor up one line.
     ll     Move the cursor right one character.
     <<ccuurrssoorr--aarrrroowwss>>
           The cursor arrow keys should work, too.
     //tteexxtt<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
           Search for the string ``text'' in the file, and move the cursor to
           its first character.

     The commands to enter new text are:
     aa     Append new text, _a_f_t_e_r the cursor.
     ii     Insert new text, _b_e_f_o_r_e the cursor.
     oo     Open a new line below the line the cursor is on, and start entering
           text.
     OO     Open a new line above the line the cursor is on, and start entering
           text.
     <<eessccaappee>>
           Once you've entered input mode using the one of the aa, ii, OO, or oo
           commands, use <<eessccaappee>> to quit entering text and return to command
           mode.

     The commands to copy text are:


     yyyy    Copy the line the cursor is on.
     pp     Append the copied line after the line the cursor is on.

     The commands to delete text are:
     dddd    Delete the line the cursor is on.
     xx     Delete the character the cursor is on.

     The commands to write the file are:
     ::ww<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
           Write the file back to the file with the name that you originally
           used as an argument on the vvii command line.
     ::ww ffiillee__nnaammee<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
           Write the file back to the file with the name ``file_name''.

     The commands to quit editing and exit the editor are:
     ::qq<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
           Quit editing and leave vi (if you've modified the file, but not
           saved your changes, vvii will refuse to quit).
     ::qq!!<<ccaarrrriiaaggee--rreettuurrnn>>
           Quit, discarding any modifications that you may have made.

     One final caution.  Unusual characters can take up more than one column
     on the screen, and long lines can take up more than a single screen line.
     The above commands work on ``physical'' characters and lines, i.e. they
     affect the entire line no matter how many screen lines it takes up and
     the entire character no matter how many screen columns it takes up.

     NNeexx//nnvvii is close to IEEE Std1003.2 (``POSIX'').  That document differs
     from historical eexx//vvii practice in several places; there are changes to be
     made on both sides.
