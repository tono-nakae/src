.Sh NAME
.Nm rfcomm_sppd
.Nd RFCOMM Serial Port Profile daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl bh
.Fl a Ar address
.Op Fl c Ar channel
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a Serial Port Profile daemon.
It opens RFCOMM connection to the specified
.Ar address
server and
.Ar channel .
Once connection is established, the
.Nm
utility provides access to the server's remote serial port via stdin/stdout
or via
.Xr pty 4
interface if
.Fl t
option was specified.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility opens both master and slave pseudo terminals.
This is done to ensure that RFCOMM connection stays open until
.Nm
is terminated.
The data received from the master pseudo terminal are sent over
the RFCOMM connection.
The data received from the RFCOMM connection are written
into master pseudo terminal.
The application in its turn opens the slave pseudo
terminal and operates on it just like it would operate over the standard serial
port.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a Ar address
This required option specifies the address of the remote RFCOMM server.
The address can be specified as BD_ADDR or name.
If name was specified then the
.Nm
utility will attempt to resolve the name via
.Xr bt_gethostbyname 3 .
.It Fl b
Detach from the controlling terminal, i.e., run in background.
.It Fl c Ar channel
This option specifies RFCOMM channel to connect to.
RFCOMM channel could either be a number between 1 and 30 or a service name.
Supported service names are:
.Cm DUN
(for DialUp Networking service),
.Cm FAX
(for Fax service),
.Cm LAN
(for LAN Access Using PPP service) and
.Cm SP
(for Serial Port service).
If channel was not specified then
.Nm
utility will try to obtain RFCOMM channel for Serial Port service via Service
Discovery Protocol from the server.
.It Fl d Ar device
Connect from the local device with the specifed address. The device can
be specified by BD_ADDR or device name. See
.Xr btconfig 8
for a list of devices available. If no
.Ar device
is specified, the connection will be set up on a system determined device.
.It Fl h
Display usage message and exit.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Slave pseudo tty name.
If not set stdin/stdout will be used.
This option is required if
.Fl b
option was specified.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".Pa /dev/tty[p-sP-S][0-9a-v]" -compact
.It Pa /dev/pty[p-sP-S][0-9a-v]
master pseudo terminals
.It Pa /dev/tty[p-sP-S][0-9a-v]
slave pseudo terminals
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl "rfcomm_sppd -a 00:01:02:03:04:05 -c 1 -t /dev/ttyp1"
.Pp
Will start the
.Nm
utility and open RFCOMM connection to the server at
.Li 00:01:02:03:04:05
and channel
.Li 1 .
Once the connection has been established,
.Pa /dev/ttyp1
can be used to talk to the remote serial port on the server, eg
with the use of
.Dl "cu -l /dev/ttyp1"
.Pp
In order to use
.Nm
to automatically create a link for
.Xr pppd 8 ,
use
.Bd -literal
	pty "rfcomm_sppd -d ubt0 -a 00:01:02:03:04:05"

.Ed
in your
.Pa /etc/ppp/options
file.
