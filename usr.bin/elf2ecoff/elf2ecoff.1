.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm elf2ecoff elf-file ecoff-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Reads a fully-linked ELF executable (such as a  linked kernel)
and produces an equivalent ECOFF format executable file.
.Pp
The
.Nm elf2ecoff
utility is used to convert native NetBSD ELF binaries
to a.out format, for compatibility with DECstation diskless-boot
PROM code and diskless-boot servers that require ECOFF format binaries.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm Elf2ecoff
assumes there are no multiply-referenced symbols in the input ELF symbol
section.   It may be necessary to link with
.Nm -x
to avoid duplicate symbols.
.Pp
In some environments, the GNU binutils
.Nm objcopy
utility may be a better solution than
.Nm elf2ecoff .
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm Elf2ecoff
was originally developed  for NetBSD/pmax by Ted Lemon
and was first distributed with the pmax port of
.Nx 1.1 .
