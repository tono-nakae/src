If output is to a terminal, then the appropriate terminal sequences

.It Fl y

note the year must be fully specified:
.Dq Li cal 89

In the USA and Great Britain the Gregorian Reformation occurred in 1752.
By this time, most countries had recognized the reformation (although a
few did not recognize it until the early 1900's.)
Eleven days following September 2, 1752 were eliminated by the reformation,
so the calendar for that month is a bit unusual.
.Sh NOTES
In view of the chaotic way the Gregorian calendar was adopted throughout
the world in the years between 1582 and 1923 make sure to take into account
the date of the Gregorian Reformation in your region if you are checking a
calendar for a very old date.
