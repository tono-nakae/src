NAME
  kdb_edit -  Kerberos key distribution center database editing utility

SYNOPSIS
  kdb_edit [ --nn ]

DESCRIPTION
  _k_d_b___e_d_i_t is used to create or change principals stored in the Kerberos key
  distribution center (KDC) database.

  When executed, _k_d_b___e_d_i_t prompts for the master key string and verifies that
  it matches the master key stored in the database.  If the --nn option is
  specified, the master key is instead fetched from the master key cache
  file.

  Once the master key has been verified, _k_d_b___e_d_i_t begins a prompt loop.  The
  user is prompted for the principal and instance to be modified.  If the
  entry is not found the user may create it.  Once an entry is found or cre-
  ated, the user may set the password, expiration date, maximum ticket life-
  time, and attributes.  Default expiration dates, maximum ticket lifetimes,
  and attributes are presented in brackets; if the user presses return the
  default is selected.  There is no default password.  The password RANDOM is
  interpreted specially, and if entered the user may have the program select
  a random DES key for the principal.

  Upon successfully creating or changing the entry, ``Edit O.K.'' is printed.

DIAGNOSTICS

  "verify_master_key: Invalid master key, does not match database."
                      The master key string entered was incorrect.
