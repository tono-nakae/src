NAME
  kdb_init - Initialize Kerberos key distribution center database

SYNOPSIS
  kdb_init [ rreeaallmm ]

DESCRIPTION
  _k_d_b___i_n_i_t initializes a Kerberos key distribution center database, creating
  the necessary principals.

  If the optional _r_e_a_l_m argument is not present, _k_d_b___i_n_i_t prompts for a realm
  name.  After determining the realm to be created, it prompts for a master
  key password.  The master key password is used to encrypt every encryption
  key stored in the database.
