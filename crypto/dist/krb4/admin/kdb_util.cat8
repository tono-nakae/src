NAME
  kdb_util -  Kerberos key distribution center database utility

SYNOPSIS
  kdb_util ooppeerraattiioonn ffiilleennaammee

DESCRIPTION
  _k_d_b___u_t_i_l allows the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) database admin-
  istrator to perform utility functions on the database.

  _O_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n must be one of the following:

  _l_o_a_d      initializes the KDC database with the records described by the
            text contained in the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  Any existing database is
            overwritten.

  _d_u_m_p      dumps the KDC database into a text representation in the file
            _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

  _s_l_a_v_e___d_u_m_p
            performs a database dump like the _d_u_m_p operation, and addition-
            ally creates a semaphore file signalling the propagation software
            that an update is available for distribution to slave KDC
            databases.

  _m_e_r_g_e     merges in the entries from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e into the database.

  _n_e_w___m_a_s_t_e_r___k_e_y
            prompts for the old and new master key strings, and then dumps
            the KDC database into a text representation in the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.
            The keys in the text representation are encrypted in the new mas-
            ter key.

  _c_o_n_v_e_r_t___o_l_d___d_b
            prompts for the master key string, and then dumps the KDC
            database into a text representation in the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  The
            existing database is assumed to be encrypted using the old format
            (encrypted by the key schedule of the master key); the dumped
            database is encrypted using the new format (encrypted directly
            with master key).

DIAGNOSTICS

  "verify_master_key: Invalid master key, does not match database."
                      The master key string entered was incorrect.
