NAME
  klist - list currently held Kerberos tickets

SYNOPSIS
  kklliisstt [ --ss | --tt ] [ --ffiillee name ] [ --ssrrvvttaabb ]

DESCRIPTION
  _k_l_i_s_t prints the name of the tickets file and the identity of the principal
  the tickets are for (as listed in the tickets file), and lists the princi-
  pal names of all Kerberos tickets currently held by the user, along with
  the issue and expire time for each authenticator.  Principal names are
  listed in the form _n_a_m_e_._i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e_@_r_e_a_l_m_, with the '.' omitted if the
  instance is null, and the '@' omitted if the realm is null.

  If given the --ss option, _k_l_i_s_t does not print the issue and expire times,
  the name of the tickets file, or the identity of the principal.

  If given the --tt option, kklliisstt checks for the existence of a non-expired
  ticket-granting-ticket in the ticket file.  If one is present, it exits
  with status 0, else it exits with status 1.  No output is generated when
  this option is specified.

  If given the --ffiillee option, the following argument is used as the ticket
  file.  Otherwise, if the KKRRBBTTKKFFIILLEE environment variable is set, it is used.
  If this environment variable is not set, the file //ttmmpp//ttkktt[[uuiidd]] is used,
  where uuiidd is the current user-id of the user.

  If given the --ssrrvvttaabb option, the file is treated as a service key file, and
  the names of the keys contained therein are printed.  If no file is speci-
  fied with a --ffiillee option, the default is _/_e_t_c_/_s_r_v_t_a_b.

FILES

  /etc/krb.conf       to get the name of the local realm

  /tmp/tkt[uid]       as the default ticket file ([uid] is the decimal UID of
                      the user).

  /etc/srvtab         as the default service key file

SEE ALSO

  kerberos(1), kinit(1), kdestroy(1)

BUGS
  When reading a file as a service key file, very little sanity or error
  checking is performed.
