NAME
  kdestroy - destroy Kerberos tickets

SYNOPSIS
  kkddeessttrrooyy [ --ff ] [ --qq ] [ --tt ]

DESCRIPTION
  The _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y utility destroys the user's active Kerberos authorization
  tickets by writing zeros to the file that contains them.  If the ticket
  file does not exist, _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y displays a message to that effect.

  After overwriting the file, _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y removes the file from the system.  The
  utility displays a message indicating the success or failure of the opera-
  tion.  If _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y is unable to destroy the ticket file, the utility will
  warn you by making your terminal beep.

  In the Athena workstation environment, the _t_o_e_h_o_l_d service automatically
  destroys your tickets when you end a workstation session.  If your site
  does not provide a similar ticket-destroying mechanism, you can place the
  _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y command in your _._l_o_g_o_u_t file so that your tickets are destroyed
  automatically when you logout.

  The options to _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y are as follows:

  --ff     _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y runs without displaying the status message.

  --qq     _k_d_e_s_t_r_o_y will not make your terminal beep if it fails to destroy the
         tickets.

  --tt     destroy tickets only and keep all AFS tokens.

  --uu     unlog, i.e remove any AFS tokens associated with the current PAG but
         leave the ticket file alone.

  If neither --tt nor --uu is given, both tickets and AFS tokens are destroyed.

FILES
  KRBTKFILE environment variable if set, otherwise
  /tmp/tkt[uid]

SEE ALSO
  kerberos(1), kinit(1), klist(1)

BUGS

  Only the tickets in the user's current ticket file are destroyed.  Separate
  ticket files are used to hold root instance and password changing tickets.
  These files should probably be destroyed too, or all of a user's tickets
  kept in a single ticket file.
