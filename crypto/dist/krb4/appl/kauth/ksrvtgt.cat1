NAME
  ksrvtgt - fetch and store Kerberos ticket-granting-ticket using a service
  key

SYNOPSIS
  kkssrrvvttggtt name instance [[realm] srvtab]

DESCRIPTION
  _k_s_r_v_t_g_t retrieves a ticket-granting ticket with a lifetime of five (5) min-
  utes for the principal _n_a_m_e_._i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e_@_r_e_a_l_m (or _n_a_m_e_._i_n_s_t_a_n_c_e_@_l_o_c_a_l_r_e_a_l_m if
  _r_e_a_l_m is not supplied on the command line), decrypts the response using the
  service key found in _s_r_v_t_a_b (or in //eettcc//ssrrvvttaabb if _s_r_v_t_a_b is not specified
  on the command line), and stores the ticket in the standard ticket cache.

  This command is intended primarily for use in shell scripts and other
  batch-type facilities.

DIAGNOSTICS
  "Generic kerberos failure (kfailure)" can indicate a whole range of prob-
  lems, the most common of which is the inability to read the service key
  file.

  /tmp/tkt[uid]       The default ticket file.
