.Sh NAME
.Nm compile_et
.Nd error table compiler
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar --version
.Op Ar --help
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads the table describing error-code names and their
associated messages in the file
.Ar file
and generates a C source file suitable for use with the
.Xr com_err 3
library.  The source file
.Ar file
must end with a suffix of ".et" and
.Nm
writes the tables to the files
.Pa file.c
and
.Pa file.h .
.Pp
The source file is a plain ASCII text file.  A "#" in the source file
is treated as a comment character, and all remaining text to the end
of the source line will be ignored.  The source file consists of the
following declarations:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width XXXXXX
.It id [ Em base ] Em string
Defines an identification string (such a a version string) which is
recorded in the generated files.  It is mandatory and must be the
first declaration in the source file.
.It et Em name
Specifies the name of the error table to be
.Em name .
It is mandatory and must be declared after the id declaration and
before all other declarations.  The optional argument
.Em base
specifies the base of the error table.
.Pp
The name of the table is used to construct the name of a function
.Fn initialize_<name>_error_table
which must be called in order for the
.Xr com_err 3
library to recognize the error table.  A re-entrant (thread-safe)
version called
.Fn initialize_<name>_error_table_r
is also defined.
.It prefix Op Em string
Defines a prefix to be applied to all error code names.  If no string
is specified, the prefix is not defined.  It is an optional
declaration and can appear more than once.
.It index Em val
Specifes the index
.Em val
in the error table for the following error code declaration.
Subsequent error codes are allocated sequentially from the same value.
It is an optional declaration and can appear more than once.
.It ec Em cname , Em msg
Defines an error code with the name
.Em cname
and its associated error message
.Em msg .
The error codes are assigned sequentially increasing numbers.  The
name is placed into the C header file as an enumerated type.
.El
.Pp
To maintain compatibility, new codes should be added to the end of an
existing table, and codes should not be removed from tables.
