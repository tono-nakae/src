You may edit various config files that usually reside in /etc on your system
using these menu entries.

Startup configuration files is your /etc/rc.conf file.  This file controls
which daemons and services are initialized at boot time.

Inetd.conf determines which services, such as ftp and telnet, are listened
for by your machine.

Mailer.conf decides which mailer your system runs by default.  NetBSD 
ships with both postfix and sendmail, though other mailers added via the 
package system may be selectable.

Usermgmt.conf determines the default behavior of the useradd/userdel 
group of commands, and sets defaults that will be used later when 
deleting or adding users with these commands.

Daily.conf is the configuration file for the daily cronjob that runs once 
each day.  It will determine what things are checked for, and emailed to 
the root user.

Weekly.conf is the configuration file for the weekly cronjob that runs 
once each week.  It is similar to the daily.conf file.

Security.conf is the configuration for the security verification script that
is optionally executed by the daily cronjob.  You may configure which 
security verifications are run on a daily basis by editing this file.

The sysctl menu allows you to both change current kernel settings, and
cause them to be automatically set on reboot using the /etc/sysctl.conf
file. 

The sshd.conf file is the configuration file for the sshd daemon.  See the
manpage for sshd(8) for more details on the configuration of this daemon.

The localtime menu allows you to set this machine's local timezone.
