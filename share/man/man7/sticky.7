.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sticky
.Nd Description of the `sticky' (S_ISVTX) bit functionality
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A special file mode, called the
.Em sticky bit
(mode
.Dv S_ISVTX ) ,
is used to indicate special treatment for directories.
See
.Xr chmod 2
or the file
.Pa /usr/include/sys/stat.h
.Sh STICKY FILES
The use of mode
.Dv S_ISVTX
is reserved and can be set only by the super-user.
.Sh STICKY DIRECTORIES
A directory whose
.Dq sticky bit
is set becomes an append-only directory, or, more accurately, a
directory in which the deletion of files is restricted.
A file in a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed
by a user if the user has write permission for the directory and
the user is the owner of the file, the owner of the directory,
or the super-user.
This feature is usefully applied to directories such as
.Pa /tmp
which must be publicly writable but should deny users the license
to arbitrarily delete or rename each others' files.
.Pp
Any user may create a sticky directory.
See
.Xr chmod 1
for details about modifying file modes.
.Sh HISTORY
The sticky bit first appeared in
.Bx 4.1 .
Its initial use was to mark executables that were frequently used
so that their text would stay in virtual memory after the process
exited.
This is where the term
.Dq sticky
comes from - the text of the program would stick around in virtual
memory.
Such executables were compiled in a way that they would have their
read-only data loaded in the text segment to minimize the amount of
work needed to load the executable.
.Xr vi 1
was one such executable.
.Pp
Later, on SunOS 4, the sticky bit got an additional meaning for
files that had the bit set and were not executable: read and write
operations from and to those files would go directly to the disk
and bypass the buffer cache.
This was typically used on swap files for NFS clients on an NFS
server, so that swap I/O generated by the clients on the servers
would not evict useful data from the server's buffer cache.
.Pp
.Nx
currently does not treat plain files that have the sticky bit
specially, but this behavior might change in the future.
.Sh BUGS
Neither
.Xr open 2
nor
.Xr mkdir 2
will create a file with the sticky bit set.
