.Dt VERIEXEC 4
.Sh NAME
.Nm veriexec
.Nd Veriexec pseudo-device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device veriexec
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Em Veriexec
verifies the integrity of specified executables and files before they are
run or read.
This makes it much more difficult to insert a trojan horse into the system
and also makes it more difficult to run binaries that are not supposed to
be running, for example, packet sniffers, DDoS clients and so on.
.Pp
The
.Nm
pseudo-device is used to preform optimal table sizing, fingerprint loading,
and querying of entries, as part of the
.Em Veriexec
subsystem.
.Ss Kernel-userland interaction
.Em Veriexec
uses
.Xr proplib 3
for communication between the kernel and userland.
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Dv VERIEXEC_TABLESIZE
Sizes the in kernel tables to accommodate the fingerprint entries.
This request must be made prior to loading the fingerprints into the kernel.
.Pp
The dictionary passed contains the following elements:
.Bl -column mount uintnnxt
.It Sy Name	Type	Purpose
.It mount	string	mount-point for the entries
.It count	uint64_t	number of entries
.El
.It Dv VERIEXEC_LOAD
Inserts a fingerprint into the in-kernel tables.
These tables must have been previously sized using the
.Dv VERIEXEC_TABLESIZE
request.
.Pp
The dictionary passed contains the following elements:
.Bl -column entryxtype string
.It Sy Name	Type	Purpose
.It file	string	filename for this entry
.It entry-type	uint8	entry type ( see below )
.It fp-type	string	fingerprint hashing algorithm
.It fp	data	the fingerprint
.El
.Pp
.Dq entry-type
can be one or more (binary-OR'd) of the following:
.Bl -column veriexecxuntrusted effect
.It Sy Type	Effect
.It Dv VERIEXEC_DIRECT	can execute directly
.It Dv VERIEXEC_INDIRECT	can execute indirectly (interpreter, Xr mmap 2 )
.It Dv VERIEXEC_FILE	can be opened
.It Dv VERIEXEC_UNTRUSTED	located on untrusted storage
.El
.It Dv VERIEXEC_DELETE
Removes either an entry for a single file or entries for an entire mount from
.Em Veriexec .
.Pp
The dictionary passed contains the following elements:
.Bl -column file string
.It Sy Name	Type	Purpose
.It file	string	filename or mount-point
.El
.It Dv VERIEXEC_QUERY
Queries
.Em Veriexec
about a file, returning information that may be useful about it.
.Pp
The dictionary passed contains the following elements:
.Bl -column file string
.It Sy Name	Type	Purpose
.It file	string	filename
.El
.Pp
The dictionary returned contains the following elements:
.Bl -column entryxtype string
.Sy Name	Type	Purpose
.It entry-type	uint8	entry type ( see above )
.It status	uint8	entry status
.It fp-type	string	fingerprint hashing algorithm
.It fp	data	the fingerprint
.El
.Pp
.Dq status
can be one of the following:
.Bl -column fingerprintxmismatch effect
.It Sy Status	Meaning
.It FINGERPRINT_NOTEVAL	not evaluated
.It FINGERPRINT_VALID	fingerprint match
.It FINGERPRINT_MISMATCH	fingerprint mismatch
.El
.El
.Pp
Note that the requests
.Dv VERIEXEC_TABLESIZE ,
.Dv VERIEXEC_LOAD ,
and
.Dv VERIEXEC_DELETE
are not permitted once the strict level has been raised past 0.
