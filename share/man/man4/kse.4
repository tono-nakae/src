.Nd Micrel 8842/8841 PCI Ethernet controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "kse* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports Ethernet interfaces based on the Micrel
8842/8841 PCI Ethernet chips.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Tohru Nishimura .
.Sh BUGS
The 8842 has 2 Ethernet ports which behave as a managed switch to
bridge each other.
It works like a T-shape connector of Ethernet data flow in which
the Ethernet controller sits at the leg of the T.
Frames can flow between the two of ports while traffic destined
for the 8842 reaches the EMAC.
The
.Nm
driver is not aware of the second port's existence and treats the
8842 as if it was a single port 8841.
The second port PHY is always auto select.
The PDF documentation is unclear and inconsistent about whether
the Rx DMA alignment restriction is removed or not.
The __STRICT_ALIGNMENT case is not written.
Advanced features like flow volume bound, VLAN tag insertion/removal,
and detailed MIB counters are not implemented and remain uncontrollable
by the
.Nm
driver.
UDP4CSUM is not very useful since the HW has an implementation
error for the case when a large UDP datagram is fragmented into
MTU sized frames.
