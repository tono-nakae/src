.Sh NAME
.Nm agr
.Nd link aggregation pseudo network interface driver
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd pseudo-device agr
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides link aggregation functionality. (aka L2 trunking or bonding)
.Pp
It supports IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) and
Marker Protocol.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following link specific flags for
.Xr ifconfig 8 :
.Bl -tag -width -link0
.It Cm link0
Use round-robin distribution algorithm.
Because it violates the frame ordering rule, don't use it unless
you're really sure.
.It Cm -link0
Use default distribution algorithm, which is based on the hash of DA/SA,
TCI, and, if available, some upper layer protocol information like
.Xr ip 4
DA/SA.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Create an
.Nm
interface,
.Sy agr0 ,
and attach
.Sy re0
and
.Sy re1
to it.
(In other words, aggregate
.Sy re0
and
.Sy re1
so that they can be used as a single interface,
.Sy agr0 )
.Bd -literal -offset indent
	ifconfig agr0 create
	ifconfig agr0 agrport re0
	ifconfig agr0 agrport re1
.Ed
.Pp
Destroy an interface created in the above example.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
	ifconfig agr0 -agrport re0
	ifconfig agr0 -agrport re1
	ifconfig agr0 destroy

.Sh BUGS
The current implementation of the
.Nm
driver
always attempts automatic configuration via LACP.
There is no way to configure statically or use non IEEE 802.3 devices.
.Pp
There is no way to configure LACP administrative variables, including
system and port priorities.
The current implementation of the
.Nm
driver always performs active-mode LACP and
uses 0x8000 as system and port priorities.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver uses the MAC address of the first-added physical
interface as the MAC address of
.Nm
interface itself.
Thus, removing the physical interface and use it for another purpose
can result in non unique MAC addresses.
.Pp
The current implementation of the
.Nm
driver doesn't prevent unsafe operations like some ioctls against
underlying physical interfaces.
Such operations can result in unexpected behaviours, and are strongly
discouraged.
.Pp
There is no way to configure
.Nm
interfaces without attaching physical interfaces.
.Pp
Physical interfaces being added to the
.Nm
interface shouldn't have any addresses except for link level address.
Otherwise, the attempt will fail with
.Dv EBUSY .
