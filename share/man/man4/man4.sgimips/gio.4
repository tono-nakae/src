.Sh NAME
.Nm gio
.Nd SGI's early PCI-like bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gio0 at imc0"
.Cd "gio0 at pic0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bus is a bus for connecting high-speed peripherals to the main memory and
CPU.
The devices themselves are typically (but not necessarily) connected to the
.Xr hpc 4
peripheral controller, and memory and CPU are accessed through the
.Xr imc 4
(Indy Memory Controller) or
.Xr pic 4
(Processor Interface Controller).
The
.Nm
bus is found on the Personal Iris 4D/3x, Indigo, Indy, Challenge-S, and
Indigo2 machines and exists in three incarnations: GIO32, GIO32-bis, and GIO64.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr grtwo 4 ,
.Xr hpc 4 ,
.Xr imc 4 ,
.Xr newport 4 ,
.Xr pic 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Sh BUGS
On Challenge-S systems only one
.Nm
expansion slot may be used with a DMA-capable device.
This is due to the fact that the IOPLUS board uses one of the slots'
DMA channels for the additional
.Xr sq 4
Ethernet.
Which slot to use with a DMA-capable card depends on the card in
question.
HPC1.5-based cards, such as the E++ Ethernet Adapter and GIO32 SCSI
Adapter, must be placed in slot #1 (next to the memory banks).
All other DMA-capable boards must be placed in slot #0 (closest to
the edge of the case).
In either case the other slot may only accomodate a PIO card.
