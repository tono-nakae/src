.Sh NAME
.Nm agp
.Nd accelerated graphics port driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "agp* at pchb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides machine-independent support for the accelerated
graphics port found on many PC-based and PCI systems.  The AGP
specification was designed by Intel.
.Pp
The AGP chipset is positioned between the PCI-Host bridge and the
graphics accelerator to provide a high-performance dedicated graphics
bus.  It currently supports a peak bandwidth of 528 MB/s.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also provides an interface to user processes for use by X
servers.  A user process communicates to the device initially by means
of
.Xr ioctl 2
calls.  The calls supported are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv AGPIOC_INFO
Get AGP information, setting the members in the
.Em agp_info
structure as defined in <sys/agpio.h>:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct _agp_info {
        agp_version version;    /* version of the driver        */
        u_int32_t bridge_id;    /* bridge vendor/device         */
        u_int32_t agp_mode;     /* mode info of bridge          */
        off_t aper_base;        /* base of aperture             */
        size_t aper_size;       /* size of aperture             */
        size_t pg_total;        /* max pages (swap + system)    */
        size_t pg_system;       /* max pages (system)           */
        size_t pg_used;         /* current pages used           */
} agp_info;
.Ed
.It Dv AGPIOC_ACQUIRE
Acquire AGP.
.It Dv AGPIOC_RELEASE
Release AGP.
.It Dv AGPIOC_SETUP
Setup AGP, using the members in the

structure as defined in <sys/agpio.h>:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct _agp_setup {
        u_int32_t agp_mode;     /* mode info of bridge          */
} agp_setup;
.Ed
.It Dv AGPIOC_ALLOCATE
Allocate AGP space, using and setting the members in the
.Em agp_allocate
structure as defined in <sys/agpio.h>:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct _agp_allocate {
        int key;                /* tag of allocation            */
        size_t pg_count;        /* number of pages              */
        u_int32_t type;         /* 0 == normal, other devspec   */
        paddr_t physical;       /* device specific (some devices
                                 * need a phys address of the

                                 * table)                       */
} agp_allocate;
.Ed
.It Dv AGPIOC_DEALLOCATE
Deallocate AGP space.
.It Dv AGPIOC_BIND

.Bd -literal
typedef struct _agp_bind {
        int key;                /* tag of allocation            */
        off_t pg_start;         /* starting page to populate    */
} agp_bind;
.Ed
.It Dv AGPIOC_UNBIND
Unbind AGP, using the members in the
.Em agp_unbind
structure as defined in <sys/agpio.h>:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct _agp_unbind {
        int key;                /* tag of allocation            */
        u_int32_t priority;     /* priority for paging out      */
