.Sh NAME
.Nm atppc
.Nd driver for AT-style parallel port chip sets
.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Cd "atppc* at acpi?"
.Cd "atppc* at ofisa?"
.Cd "atppc* at pnpbios? index ?"
.Cd "atppc* at puc? port ?"
.Cd options ATPPC_VERBOSE
.Cd options ATPPC_DEBUG
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
supports parallel ports and provides the low level support needed
by higher level drivers such as
.Xr ppbus 4 .
This driver attaches where the traditional
.Nx
.Xr lpt 4
driver would ordinarily.
It provides the data transport and chip set manipulation needed by
higher driver layers.
This driver is designed to be one of many possible implementations
supporting machine independent parallel device support via
.Xr ppbus 4 .
.Ss IEEE 1284 support
.Nm
is intended to provide to data-link like services to higher level IEEE 1284
device drivers (such as
.Xr ppbus 4 ) .
.Nm
does not directly support IEEE 1284 features such as mode negotiation
but rather provides the necessary infrastructure to allow a higher
level driver to provide these services.
.Pp
.Nm
does provide chip set manipulation, device handshakes (where
appropriate), low-level error detection, and data transfer.
.Ss Supported data transfer modes
.Nm
supports the following data transfer modes: Centronics Compatible
(Standard), Nibble, Byte (PS2), Fast Centronics, ECP, and EPP.
Standard and Fast Centronics modes are write only, Nibble and Byte
modes are read only, and ECP and EPP modes are bidirectional.
.Ss Software Interfaces
The driver provides some generic methods that can apply to many
AT-like parallel port devices (such as non-generic chip sets): see
.Xr atppc 9 .
.Nm
implements the parport interface defined in
.Xr ppbus 9 .
.Ss Supported Devices
.Nm
supports only generic chip sets on the ISA bus.
The original
.Fx
.Nm ppc
driver included support for other chip sets, but this driver is
still under development.
Generic chip sets configured by other means besides ISA are also
not supported, but are being planned.

.Sh HISTORY
The
