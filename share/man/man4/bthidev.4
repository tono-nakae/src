.Pp
.Cd "btkbd*   at bthidev? reportid ?"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver handles all Bluetooth Human Interface Devices.  Each HID
device can have several components, e.g., a keyboard and a mouse.
These components use different report identifiers to
distinguish which component data is coming from.  The
.Nm
driver has other drivers attached that handle particular
kinds of devices and
.Nm
only dispatches data to them based on the report id.
.Pp
Normally, Bluetooth HIDs will be attached using the
.Xr btcontrol 8
program.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Iain Hibbert
under the sponsorship of Itronix, Inc. and first appeared in
.Nx 4.0 .
