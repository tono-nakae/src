.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd qms* at iomd?
.Cd wsqms* at iomd?
.Cd wsmouse* at wsqms?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These drivers provide interfaces to an IOMD quadrature mouse, found on
IOMD20-based systems such as the Acorn Risc PC.
The
.Nm qms
driver provides an interface compatible with the
.Xr busmouse 4
protocol, while the
.Nm wsqms
driver interfaces to the
.Xr wsmouse 4
driver to provide a generic, machine-independent mouse interface.

These two drivers should be merged, or the old interface removed entirely.
