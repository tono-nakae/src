.Sh NAME
.Nm ioasic
.Nd
turbochannel SCSI adaptor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ioasic? at mainbus"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the DEC proprietary IOCTL asic found on
Decstation 5000  series machines (excluding the 5000/200), and on
Turbochannel-based Alphas.   On these machines (including the
5000/200), all baseboard  devices should be configured as children
of the
.Nm ioasic .
The
.nm
provides hardware DMA channels and interrupt support for
several baseboard devices, including one
.Nm asc
scsi device with a scatter/gather DMA channel, up to two
.Nm scc
devices, a
.Nm tc
turbochannel expansion bus with  two, three, or six slots.
.Pp
The
.Nm
is also used for theose 
floppy-disc drive and audio/ISDN hardware
on the Personal Decstation and Alpha.
.Nm
hardware is used to interface to
a
scatter-gather DMA channel.
.Pp
Support for scatter-gather DMA eliminates the need for copying.
A baseboard
.Nm asc
SCSI adaptor attached to an
.Nm ioasic 
will give slightly better performance than its
.Nm tc
counterpart.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
first appeared in
.Nx 1.1 ,
derived from the
.Sh BUGS
The Decstation 5000/200 does not actually have an
.Nm ioasic
chip, but for consistency it must be configured as if it
did.
