.Sh NAME
.Nm wd 
.Nd WD100x compatible hard disk driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wd* at wdc? channel ? drive ? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "wd* at pciide? channel ? drive ? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm wd 
driver supports hard disk which emulate the Western
Digital WD100x.  This includes standard MFM, RLL, ESDI, IDE and EIDE
drives.
.Pp
The flags are used only with controllers with mode settings support (like
some PCIIDE controllers). The first 4 bytes of the flags define the PIO mode
to use, the second DMA mode and the third UltraDMA mode. For each group of 4
bytes, the 3 lower define the mode to use, and the last one must be 1 for the
setting to be used. For DMA and UDMA, 0xf means 'disable'. For example, 0x0fac
means 'use PIO mode 4 DMA mode 2, disable UltraDMA'. 0x0000 means "use whatever
the drive claims to support.
