.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nx
provides machine-independent bus support for
.Tn ACPI
devices.
.Pp
The
.Dv "ACPI_PCI_FIXUP"
option enables ACPI-based PCI interrupt routing fixup.
.Pp
The
.Dv "ACPI_ACTIVATE_DEV"
option determines if the ACPI driver should attempt to activate
inactive devices.  The default is off.
