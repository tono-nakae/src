.Os NetBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm isa
.Nd introduction to ISA bus machine-independent drivers and support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Pp
Machine-dependent; depends on the bus topology and ISA-host adaptor
of your system.  Typical ISA buses are connected either directly to the
main system bus or via PCI-ISA bridges. See the
.Xr intro 4
documentation for your system for details.
.Sh INTRODUCTION
.Nx 1.2 
and later versions include  machine-independent bus support and
drivers for  the following ISA  bus devices.
Not all supported ISA devices are listed below.
Consult the
.Xr intro 4
section for your CPU for additional machine-dependent  drivers.
Note that console support (cga, ega, vga, or better)  and
NS8250/16450/16550 serial drivers are  currently machine-dependent and
documented elsewhere.
