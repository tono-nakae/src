.Sh NAME
.Nm verifiedexec
.Nd Verified exec signature loader device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd options VERIFIED_EXEC
.Cd pseudo-device verifiedexec 1
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a method of loading the fingerprints used by the
verified exec feature.
The fingerprints are loaded by opening
.Nm
and then using the
.Dv VERIEXECLOAD
ioctl to feed the fingerprints into kernel space.
Note that the loading should only be done after a mount of all file systems
that contain files which have fingerprints associated with them.
Signatures may only be loaded when the kernel
.Dv securelevel
is set to 0.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Nm
device will return
.Er EPERM
if
.Dv securelevel
is greater than 0.
An
.Er ENOENT
error will be returned if the file path passed in does not exist.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was originally written for
.Nx
by
.An Brett Lymn .
