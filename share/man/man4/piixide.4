.Sh NAME
.Nm piixide
.Nd Intel IDE disk controllers driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "piixide* at pci? dev ? function ? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "options PCIIDE_I31244_ENABLEDMA"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Intel PIIX, PIIX3, PIIX4, i31244 Serial ATA, and
82801 (ICH/ICH0/ICH2/ICH3/ICH4/ICH5) IDE controllers,
and provides the interface with the hardware for the
.Xr ata 4
driver.
.Pp
The 0x0002 flag forces the
.Nm
driver to disable DMA on chipsets for which DMA would normally be
enabled.
This can be used as a debugging aid, or to work around
problems where the IDE controller is wired up to the system incorrectly.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr atapi 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr pciide 4 ,
.Xr wd 4 ,
.Xr wdc 4
.Sh BUGS
The Intel i31244 Serial ATA controller revision 0 has a bug affecting
DMA data transfers.
The PCIIDE_I31244_ENABLEDMA option can be used to force DMA on the
buggy revisions.
.Pp
The timings used for the PIO and DMA modes for controllers listed above
are for a PCI bus running at 30 or 33 MHz.
This driver may not work properly on overclocked systems.
