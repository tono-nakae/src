.Sh NAME
.Nm dtvi2c
.Nd iic-connected support modules for dtv
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
modules are drivers for support hardware needed by DVB devices.
This includes e.g. tuners, demodulators, and analog video decoders.
.Pp
The usual hardware structure consists of a host controller
(connected via
.Xr usb 4
or
.Xr pci 4 )
that provides the data moving facilities (for the analog or
digital video streams) and an
.Xr iic 4
bus over which the other chips can be configured.
.Pp
For example, a typical
.Xr dtv 4
setup would look like this:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
initialize transport stream (TS) port on host controller
.It
configure demodulator (put it in the ATSC/QAM/DVB-T/etc. mode)
.It
configure tuner (set frequency etc.)
.It
start TS transfer (using DMA transfers or USB high speed transfers)
.El
.Pp
The currently supported modules are:
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset indent
.It au8522
Auvitek AU8522 ATSC/QAM64/QAM256 demodulator
.It cx24227
