.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn Direct Rendering Manager
is part of the
.Tn Direct Rendering Infrastructure
for supporting video acceleration (3d acceleration, mostly).
.Pp
The
.Nm
drivers provide support for the following chipsets:
.Bl -tag -width XsavagedrmXXX -offset indent -compact
.It i915drm
Intel i915, i945
.It mach64drm
Mach64 (3D Rage Pro, Rage)
.It mgadrm
Matrox G[24]00, G[45]50
.It r128drm
ATI Rage 128
.It radeondrm
ATI Radeon
.It savagedrm
S3 Savage
.It sisdrm
SiS
.It tdfxdrm
3dfx (Voodoo)
.It viadrm
VIA
.El
.Pp
To make use of the driver,
.Xr X 7
must be compiled with DRI support, Mesa DRI drivers must be installed,
the appropriate
.Pa /dev/dri/card*
device must exist, and DRI must be enabled in the X configuration
file.
.Pp
Details for these steps:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
X must be compiled with DRI support.
.It
Mesa should be compiled for the netbsd-dri target, patch available at
.Pa http://issc.uj.ac.za/~yorick/drm/mesa.patch
.It
The device node must exist:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mkdir -p /dev/dri
mknod /dev/dri/card0 c 34 0
chgrp wheel /dev/dri/card0
chmod 0660 /dev/dri/card0
.Ed
.It
Enable DRI in the X configuration (either
.Pa xorg.conf
or
.Pa XF86Config ) :
.Bd -literal
Section "Module"
        ...
        Load  "dri"
        Load  "GLcore"
        Load  "glx"
EndSection
...
Section "DRI"
        Group "wheel"
        Mode 0660
EndSection

.\" .Sh HISTORY
.\" The
.\" .Nm
.\" driver first appeared in
.\" ??
.\" and then it was ported to
.\" .Nx 5.0 .
.\" .Sh AUTHORS
.\" .An -nosplit
.\" The
.\" .Nm
.\" driver was written by
.\" .An ??
.\" and
.\" .An Yorick Hardy
.\" who adapted the code for
.\" .Nx .
.Sh CAVEATS
Disable AIGLX if necessary
.Pq Pa xorg.conf :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Section "ServerFlags"
        Option  "AIGLX" "off"
EndSection

Section "Extensions"
        Option "Composite" "Disable"
EndSection

.Pp
In case of errors,
.Pa /dev/dri/card0
may be changed, make sure to recreate it in that case.
.Pp
.Cd options DRM_DEBUG
can slow DRI down a lot, disable it once
.Nm
works.
