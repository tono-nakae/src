.Sh NAME
.Nm ep
.Nd Ethernet driver for 3Com Etherlink III (3c5x9)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
device ep0 at isa? port 0x350 net irq 5 vector epintr
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Configuration information for the
.Nm ep
device driver.

3c5x9 cards have various combinations of connectors on them including:

.nf
.in +9
AUI/DIX
10Base2 (BNC)
10BaseT (UTP)
.in -9
.fi

Consequently; the flags for ifconfig(8) are as follows:

.nf
.in +9
Flag            Description                     Result
----            -----------                     ------
-link0          Enable internal Transceiver     (BNC/UTP)
link0           Disable internal Transceiver    (AUI)
link1           Enable 10BaseT                  (UTP)
-link1          Disable 10BaseT                 (BNC)
.in -9
.fi

Thus to enable 10BaseT you would "ifconfig ep0 link0 link1"

It does not make sense to "ifconfig ep0 -link0 link1"

The default is "-link0".

.Sh NOTES
Since the driver has no jumpers, the autoconfig routines scribbles 
all over 0x100 to get the attention of any 3c509 cards that may
be in the machine.  If you have any other hardware that lives at
0x100, then you should put any ep drivers before that hardware
in your config file.

Some models of 3c5x9 have all three connectors on them.  In the case of these
cards; you must configure the transceiver type with the configuration 
disk before the link0/link1 flags will operate correctly.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
ep%d: reset (status: %x)
.in +4
the driver has encountered a FIFO underrun or overrun. The driver will reset
the card and the packet will be lost. This is not fatal.
.in -4
ep%d: eeprom failed to come ready
.in +4
The eeprom failed to come ready.  This probably means the card is wedged.
.in -4
ep%d: 3c509 in test mode. Erase pencil mark!
.in +4
This means that someone has scribbled with pencil in the test area on the
card.  Erase the pencil mark and reboot.  (This is not a joke).
.in -4
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh STANDARDS
are great. There's so many to choose from.
