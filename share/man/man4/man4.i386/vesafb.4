.Dt VESAFB 4 i386
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vesafb
.Nd VESA BIOS extensions 2.0 and above framebuffer device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vesafb* at vesabios?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at vesafb? console ?"
.Pp
.Cd options VESAFB_WIDTH=640
.Cd options VESAFB_HEIGHT=480
.Cd options VESAFB_DEPTH=8
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
provides support for framebuffer consoles on i386 display adapters which
implement VESA BIOS extensions (VBE) 2.0 or above. Since this interface
is accessed via x86 BIOS calls, this driver only works on the i386 port.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver attaches to the console very early in the i386 boot process; since
consinit() is called before KVM86 is initialized, the vesafb_cnattach()
function assumes that hardware is present. This causes the console to be
blank until the
.Nm
driver attaches.
.Pp
.Nm
does not support VBE 1.2 and below, as they do not provide support for
linear framebuffers.
