.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Op Fl m Ar mknod
.Bro Pa all | site-specific-argument Brc Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create site-specific device special files.
Each argument may be the word
.Pa all
or a site-specific argument.
By default, there are no valid site-specific arguments,
and the
.Pa all
argument has no effect;
This may be changed by editing the script.
.Pp
The script is in
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV.local
and must be called from the
.Pa /dev
directory.
.Pp
If
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
is invoked with the
.Pa all
or
.Pa local
argument, then it will invoke
.Nm
with the
.Pa all
argument.

Supported options for
.Nm
are the same as for
.Xr MAKEDEV 8 ,
as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XmXmknodXX
.It Fl f
Force permissions to be updated on existing devices.
.It Fl m Ar mknod
Name of
.Xr mknod 8
program.
[Usually, $TOOL_MKNOD or mknod.]
