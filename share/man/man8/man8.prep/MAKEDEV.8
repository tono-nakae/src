.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create system and device special files.
As arguments it takes the names of known devices, like
.Ar sd0 ,
or of special targets, like
.Pa all
or
.Pa std ,
which create a collection of device special files.
.Pp
The script is in
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
and must be called from the
.Pa /dev
directory.
.Pp
The special targets supported on
.Nx Ns / Ns prep
are:
