.Sh NAME
.Nm altboot
.Nd program to boot
.Nx
kernel from disk or network
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a
.Nx
program which works on top of a
.Tn NAS
product's bootloader.
It is capable of loading a
.Nx
kernel from an
.Tn IDE
or
.Tn SATA
disk drive, or via network with
.Tn NFS
or
.Tn TFTP
protocol.
.Nm
can be stored in flash ROM.
Typically you will first copy it from flash into RAM and then invoke
it there to boot the
.Nx
kernel.
.Pp
.Nm
runs in conjunction with popular
.Tn U-Boot/PPCBoot
bootloaders used by
.Tn NAS
products.
With an appropriate boot command line, saved in the environment,
.Nm
can load and start a
.Nx
kernel without manual intervention.
The original
.Tn U-Boot/PPCBoot
bootloaders remain useful and altboot works as a functional extension
of them.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
occupies less than 128KB in volume and can be stored to any vacant
space of the system's flash.
It is made to run at RAM address offset 0x0100'0000.
.Tn U-Boot/PPCboot
is instructed to copy the program to RAM in this way:
.Pp
.Dl => cp.b fffe0000 1000000 20000
.Pp
Here 0xfffe'0000 is the flash address where
.Nm
is stored while 0x0100'0000 is the RAM address to copy to.
.Pp
The invocation syntax is:
.Pp
.Dl => go 1000000 Ar opt1 Ar opt2 ... Ar bootname
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Va optN
multi, auto, ask, single, ddb, userconf, norm, quiet, verb,
silent, debug
.Pp
Omitting optN makes
.Nm
default to multi-user mode boot.
.Pp
N.B., the maximum number of the go command argument varies
and depends on the
.Tn U-Boot/PPCBoot
buildtime configuration.
.It Va bootname
One of the following:
.Pp
.Dl nfs: Ns Ar filename
.Dl nfs:
.Dl tftp: Ns Ar filename
.Dl tftp:
.Dl wd Ns Ar Np Ns : Ns Ar filename
.Dl wd Ns Ar Np Ns :
.Dl net:
.Pp
The last one is a synonym of
.Dq nfs .
.It nfs: Ns Va filename
issue a
.Tn DHCP
request to determine the
.Tn IP
address and download
.Em filename
from the
.Tn NFS
server.
.It nfs:
target file is determined by
.Sy filename
field of
.Pa /etc/dhcpd.conf
.It tftp: Ns Va filename
issue a
.Tn DHCP
request to determine
.Tn IP
address and download
.Em filename
from the
.Tn TFTP
server.
.It tftp:
target file is determined by
.Sy filename
field of
.Pa /etc/dhcpd.conf
.It wd Ns Va Np : Ns Va filename
load the
.Tn ELF
.Nx
kernel
.Em filename
from an
.Tn FFSv2
or
.Tn FFSv1
filesystem.
.Em N
is a number to distinguish the target drive.
.Em p
is a partition specifier.
When omitted, partition
.Sq a
is assumed.
.Dq wd0a
means partition
.Sq a
of the first disk drive.
.It wd Ns Va Np :
use filename
.Dq netbsd
for booting the
.Tn ELF
.Nx
kernel.
.El
.Pp
.Tn U-Boot/PPCBoot
provides a way to run a short list of commands right after power-on.
The following is a procedure to setup the system for starting
.Nx
after a 5 second delay, allowing the user to break into interactive
mode.
Note that a backslashed
.Sq \&;
is necessary to enter the script correctly.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
=> setenv bootcmd cp.b fffe0000 1000000 20000\e; go 1000000 wd0:
=> setenv bootdelay 5
=> saveenv
