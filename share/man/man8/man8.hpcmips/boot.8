.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\"
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
.\"
Unfortunately, on most machines, the system can't reboot itself
at power-up or after crashes.
You might have to restart the system manually.
Once the system starts, an automatic consistency check of the file systems
will be performed,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.\"
.Ss Cold starts
.\"
Typical MIPS based Windows CE Handheld machines
attempt to boot Windows CE operating system in its own boot ROM.
You can't boot the
.Nx
directly skipping Windows CE.
The
.Nx 
bootloaders are provided as application programs on Windows CE instead.
You can choose
.Xr pbsdboot 8
or hpcboot.
Though the bootloaders are application programs,
they blow away entire Windows CE OS and it's settings 
when kernel boots successfully.
.\"
.Ss Normal Operation
.\"
Once running, a familiar window will appear. You can choose machine type,
kernel file locaion and kernel boot options with GUI and push the button
named
.Dq Li [boot]
to boot the
.Nx .
.\"
.Ss Automatic mode
.\"
The bootloaders have
.Dq Li auto boot
option. If you enable this option,
specified kernel will be loaded automatically
after a countdown.
