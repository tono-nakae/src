.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tm
.Nd time structure
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In time.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.In time.h
header defines the following structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct tm {
	int		 tm_sec;
	int		 tm_min;
	int		 tm_hour;
	int		 tm_mday;
	int		 tm_mon;
	int		 tm_year;
	int		 tm_wday;
	int		 tm_yday;
	int		 tm_isdst;
	long		 tm_gmtoff;
	__aconst char	*tm_zone;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The members are:
.Bl -column -offset indent \
"Member  " "Months since January 1     "  "Range "
.It Sy Member Ta Sy Represents Ta Sy Range
.It Va tm_sec Ta Seconds Ta [0, 61]
.It Va tm_min Ta Minutes Ta [0, 59]
.It Va tm_hour Ta Hours since midnight Ta [0, 23]
.It Va tm_mday Ta Day of the month Ta [1, 31]
.It Va tm_mon Ta Months since January Ta [0, 11]
.It Va tm_year Ta Years since 1900 Ta
.It Va tm_wday Ta Days since Sunday Ta [0,  6]
.It Va tm_yday Ta Days since January 1 Ta [0, 365]
.It Va tm_isdt Ta Positive if daylight savings Ta >= 0
.It Va tm_gmtoff Ta Offset from UTC in seconds Ta
.It Va tm_zone Ta Timezone abbreviation
.El
.Pp
The
.Vt tm
structure is used by various common library routines such as
.Xr mktime 3 ,
.Xr localtime 3 ,
and
.Xr strptime 3 .
All except
.Va tm_gmtoff
and
.Va tm_zone
are defined in
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Ss NetBSD Extensions
The
.Va tm_zone
and
.Va tm_gmtoff
fields exist, and are filled in by applicable library routines,
only if arrangements to do so were made when the library containing
these functions was created.
There is no guarantee that these fields will continue to exist
in this form in future releases of
. Nx .
.Pp
The
.Fa tm_gmtoff
field denotes the offset (in seconds) of the time represented
from UTC, with positive values indicating east
of the Prime Meridian.
The
.Vt tm_zone
field will become invalid and point to freed storage if the corresponding
.Va "struct tm"
was returned by
.Xr localtime_rz 3
and the
.Ft "const timezone_t"
.Fa tz
argument has been freed by
.Xr tzfree 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr timeval 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Vt tm
structure conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
