.Sh NAME
.Nm kthread_create1 ,
.Nm kthread_exit ,
.Nm kthread_create
.Nd kernel threads
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/kthread.h>
.Ft void
.Fn kthread_create "void (*func)(void)" "void *arg"
.Ft void
.Fn kthread_exit "int ecode"
.Ft int
.Fn kthread_create1 "void (*func)(void)" "void *arg" "struct proc **newpp" \
"const char *fmt" "..."
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Kernel threads are light-weight processes which execute entirely
within the kernel.  Any process can request the creation of a new
kernel thread.  Kernel threads are not swapped out during memory
congestion.  The VM space and limits are shaed with proc0 (usually
.Xr init 8 ) .
.Sh FUNCTIONS
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Fn kthread_create1 "func" "arg" "newpp" "fmt" "..."
Fork a kernel thread.
.Fa newpp
is a pointer the the new proc structure for the kernel thread.
The function
.Fa func
is called with arguments
.Fa arg
to commence execution.
.Fa fmt
is a string containing format information used to display the kernel
thread name.
.It Fn kthread_create "void (*func)(void)" "void *arg"
Register function
.Fa func
to defer creation of the kernel thread.  Deferral of kernel thread
creation is required during system startup when kernel thread resources
are not available.
.It Fn kthread_exit "int ecode"
Exit from a kernel thread.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn kthread_create1
returns 0.  Otherwise, the following error values are returned:
.Bl -tag -width [EAGAIN]
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The limit on the total number of system processes would be exceeded.
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The limit
.Dv RLIMIT_NPROC
on the total number of processes under execution by this
user id would be exceeded.
