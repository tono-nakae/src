.Sh NAME
.Nm pathname
.Nd pathname management interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/namei.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides an easy way to manage memory buffers used to hold pathnames.
It provides three functions:
.Pp
.Bl -tag
.It Ft pathname_t Fn pathname_get "const char *dirp" "enum uio_segflg seg"
Takes a pointer to a pathname buffer,
.Ar dirp ,
and an argument indicating in what address space it is located at,
.Ar seg ;
.Dv UIO_SYSSPACE
or
.Dv UIO_USERSPACE
for kernel-space and user-space, respectively.
.It Ft char * Fn pathname_path "pathname_t pn"
Takes a
.Ft pathname_t
argument as returned from a previous call to
.Fn pathname_get ,
.Ar pn ,
and returns a pointer to the pathname buffer.
This pointer is safe to use in the kernel.
.It Ft void pathname_put "pathname_t pn"
Frees all memory associated with
.Ar pn .
.Fn kmem_zalloc
is the equivalent of
.Fn kmem_alloc ,
except that it initializes the memory to zero.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr namei 9

.Sh CAVEATS
If the buffer is located in kernel-space,
.Fn pathname_get
will reuse it.
.Pp
The
.Nm
interface is experimental and subject to change.
Its existence should not be relied on.
