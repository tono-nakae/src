.It Fa oldlwp
Specify the lwp from which we are going to switch, i.e.,
the calling LWP.
If it was
.Dv NULL ,
the context of the LWP currently running on this processor is not saved.
.It Fa newlwp
Specify the lwp to which we are going to switch.
It must not be
.Dv NULL .

.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn cpu_switchto
