"once_t *control" "void (*init_func)(void)"
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn RUN_ONCE
provides a functionality similar to
.Fn pthread_once 3 .
It ensures that
.Fn init_func
is called exactly once for given
.Fa control .
It can sleep if it's called concurrently.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows how
.Fn RUN_ONCE
is used.
Regardless of how many times
.Fn some_func
is executed,
.Fn init_func
will be executed exactly once.
.Bd -literal
static void
init_func(void)
{

	/*
	 * do some initialization.
	 */
}

int
some_func(void)
{
	static DECL_ONCE(control);

	RUN_ONCE(\*[Am]control, init_func);

	/*
	 * we are sure that init_func has already been completed here.
	 */
}
