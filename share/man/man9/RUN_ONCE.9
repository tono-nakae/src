"once_t *control" "int (*init_func)(void)"
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn RUN_ONCE
provides a functionality similar to
.Fn pthread_once 3 .
It ensures that successful execution of
.Fn init_func
is exactly once for given
.Fa control .
If and only if
.Fn init_func
returned 0, it's considered as a successul execution.
.Pp
.Fn RUN_ONCE
can sleep if it's called concurrently.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On failure,
.Fn RUN_ONCE
returns what
.Fn init_func
returned.
Otherwise, it returns 0.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example shows how
.Fn RUN_ONCE
is used.
Regardless of how many times
.Fn some_func
is executed,
.Fn init_func
will be executed exactly once.
.Bd -literal
static int
init_func(void)
{

	/*
	 * do some initialization.
	 */

	return 0; /* success */
}

int
some_func(void)
{
	static DECL_ONCE(control);

	RUN_ONCE(\*[Am]control, init_func);

	/*
	 * we are sure that init_func has already been completed here.
	 */
}
