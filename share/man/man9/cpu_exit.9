.Sh NAME
.Nm cpu_exit
.Nd machine-dependent process exit
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include \*[Lt]sys/systm.h\*[Gt]
.Ft void
.Fn cpu_exit "struct proc *p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn cpu_exit
is machine-dependent code invoked by
.Fn exit1
as the last action during process exit to switch to a new context
(possibly the idle context).
.Fn cpu_exit
will clean up machine-dependent process state and invoke
.Fn exit2
to schedule the old process's u-area and stack to be released by the
reaper thread.
.Fn cpu_exit
will then invoke
.Fn cpu_switch
to wait for another process to wake up.
.Pp
Note that
.Fn cpu_exit
should be called at
.Xr splhigh 9 .
.Sh CODE REFERENCES
This section describes places within the
.Nx
