.Sh NAME
.Nm return_address
.Nd return address
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In i386/return.h
.Ft void *
.Fn return_address "unsigned int level"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function evaluates to the first return address on the call stack
if
.Fa level
equals 0, or else
to the return address for the stack frame
.Fa level
frames down.
.Pp
This function is intended to be called by diagnostic code to record
the call stack.
.Pp
A special fault handler stops
.Nm
from crashing the kernel by examining a non-existent or corrupt stack
frame.
.Pp
Kernel compilation options affect both the ability of
.Nm
to locate return addresses on the stack, and the programmer's
ability to interpret the addresses.
The compiler may optimize away the stack frame pointers that
.Nm
depends on.
To use
.Nm
effecively, try a kernel configuration option such as
.Bd -literal
makeoptions     DEBUG="-g -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -O0"
.Ed
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm
returns the
requested return address, or
.Dv NULL
if it cannot dissect the call stack.
