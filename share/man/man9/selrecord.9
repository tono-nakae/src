.Dt SELRECORD 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm selrecord ,
.Nm selwakeup
.Nd record and wakeup select requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/select.h
.Ft void
.Fn selrecord "struct lwp *selector" "struct selinfo *sip"
.Ft void
.Fn selwakeup "struct selinfo *sip"
.Ft void
.Fn selnotify "struct selinfo *sip" "long knhint"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn selrecord
and
.Fn selwakeup
are used by device drivers to coordinate
with the kernel implementation of
.Xr select 2
and
.Xr poll 2 .
Each object that can be polled contains a 
.Dv selinfo
record.
Device drivers provide locking for the
.Dv selinfo
record.
.Pp
.Fn selrecord
records that the calling thread is interested in events related to a given
object.
.Fn selrecord
should only be called when the poll routine determines that the object
is not ready for I/O: there are no events of interest pending.
The check for pending I/O and call to 
.Fn selrecord
must be atomic.
Atomicity can be provided by holding the object's lock across the test
and call to 
.Fn selrecord .
For non-MPSAFE drivers, the global
.Dv kernel_lock
is enough to provide atomicity.
.Pp
.Fn selwakeup
is called by the underlying object handling code in order to notify any waiting
threads that an event of interest has occurred.
The same lock held across the poll method and call to 
.Fn selrecord
must be held across the call to 
.Fn selwakeup .
The lock prevents an event of interest being signalled while a thread is
in the process of recording its interest.
.Pp
.Fn selnotify
calls
.Fn selwakeup
and then calls
.Fn KNOTE
with
.Va knhint .
In most cases,
.Fn selnotify
should be used rather than using
.Fn selwakeup
directly.
As with
.Fn selwakeup
the object's lock must be held.
