.Sh NAME
.Nm selrecord ,
.Nm selwakeup
.Nd record and wakeup select requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/select.h
.Ft void
.Fn selrecord "struct lwp *selector" "struct selinfo *sip"
.Ft void
.Fn selwakeup "struct selinfo *sip"
.Ft void
.Fn selnotify "struct selinfo *sip" "long knhint"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn selrecord
and
.Fn selwakeup
are the two central functions used by
.Xr select 2 ,
.Xr poll 2 ,
and the objects that are being selected on.
They handle the task of recording which threads are waiting on which objects
and the waking of the proper threads when an event of interest occurs on an
object.
.Pp
.Fn selrecord
records that the calling thread is interested in events related to a given
object.
.Pp
.Fn selwakeup
is called by the underlying object handling code in order to notify any waiting
threads that an event of interest has occurred.
.Pp
.Fn selnotify
calls
.Fn selwakeup
and then calls
.Fn KNOTE
with
.Va knhint .
In most cases,
.Fn selnotify
should be used rather than using
.Fn selwakeup
directly.
