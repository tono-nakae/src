.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn cpu_idle
is called by machine-independent code when the processor has
nothing to do.
It can be used to conserve the processor power, for example.
.Pp
.Fn cpu_idle
returns as soon as possible when
.Fn cpu_need_resched
is called for the processor.
Otherwise, it returns whenever it likes.
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh EXAMPLES
The simplest (and, in some cases, the best) implementation of
.Fn cpu_idle
is the following.
.Bd -literal
	void
	cpu_idle(void)
	{
		/* nothing */
	}
