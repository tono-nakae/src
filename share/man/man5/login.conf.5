.Sh NAME
.Nm login.conf
.Nd login class capability data base
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/login.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm login.conf
file describes the various attributes of login classes.
A login class determines what styles of authentication are available
as well as session resource limits and environment setup.
While designed primarily for the
.Xr login 8
program,
it is also used by other programs, e.g.,
.Xr rexecd 8 ,
which need to set up a user environment.
.Sh CAPABILITIES
Refer to
.Xr getcap 3
for a description of the file layout.
All entries in the
.Nm login.conf
file are either boolean or use a `=' to separate the capability
from the value.
The types are described after the capability table.

.\"XX The maximum and current limits may be specified individually by appending
.\"XX a
.\"XX .Va \-max

.\"XX and

.Pp
\*(oSwill never define capabilities which start with
Li x-
or
.Li X- ,
these are reserved for external use (unless included through contributed
software).
.Pp
The argument types are defined as:
.Bl -tag -width programxx
.\"
.It file
Path name to a text file.
.\"
.It list
A comma separated list of values.
.\"
.It number
A number.  A leading
.Li 0x
implies the number is expressed in hexadecimal.
A leading
.Li 0
implies the number is expressed in octal.
Any other number is treated as decimal.
.\"
.It path
A space separated list of path names.
If a
.Li ~
is the first character in the path name, the
.Li ~
is expanded to the user's home directory.
.\"
.It program
A path name to program.
.\"
.It size
A
.Va number
which expresses a size in bytes.
It may have a trailing
.Li b
to multiply the value by 512, a
.Li k
to multiply the value by 1 K (1024), and a
.Li m
to multiply the value by 1 M (1048576).
.\"
.It time
A time in seconds.
A time may be expressed as a series of numbers
which are added together.
Each number may have a trailing character to
represent time units:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.\"
.It y
Indicates a number of 365 day years.
.\"
.It w
Indicates a number of 7 day weeks.
.\"
.It d
Indicates a number of 24 hour days.
.\"
.It h
Indicates a number of 60 minute hours.
.\"
.It m
Indicates a number of 60 second minutes.
.\"
.It s
Indicates a number of seconds.
.El
.Pp
For example, to indicate 1 and 1/2 hours, the following string
could be used:
.Li 1h30m .
.El
.\"
.Pp
The class to be used is normally determined by the
.Li class
field in the password file (see
.Xr passwd 5 ).
.Pp
The class is used to look up a corresponding entry in the
.Pa login.conf
file.
