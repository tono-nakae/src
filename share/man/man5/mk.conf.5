.Sh NAME
.Nm mk.conf
.Nd make configuration file
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file overrides various parameters used during the build of the system.
.Pp
Listed below are the
.Nm
variables that may be set, the values to which each may be set,
a brief description of what each variable does, and a reference to
relevant manual pages.
.
.Ss NetBSD System variables
.
.de YorN
Can be set to
.Dq yes
or
.Dq no .
..
.de DFLT
.Pp
.Em Default :
..
.de DFLTu
.DFLT
Unset.
..
.de DFLTy
.DFLT
.Dq yes
..
.de DFLTn
.DFLT
.Dq no
..
The basic rule for the variable naming scheme is as follows:
.Bl -tag -width USE_XXX
.
.It Sy MKxxx
Can be set to
.Dq no
to disable functionality, or
.Dq yes 
to enable it.
Usually defaults to 
.Dq yes ,
although some variables
default to
.Dq no .
.Pp
Due to
.Xr make 1
implementation issues, if a temporary command-line override of a
.Pa mk.conf or
\*[Lt]bsd.own.mk\*[Gt]
setting is required whilst still honouring a particular
Makefile's setting of
MKxxx ,
use
.Dl Ic env MKxxx=value make
instead of
.Dl Ic make MKxxx=value
.Pp
.It Sy NOxxx
If defined, disables a feature.
Not intended for users.
This is to allow Makefiles to disable functionality
that they don't support (such as missing man pages).
NOxxx variables must be defined before \*[Lt]bsd.own.mk\*[Gt]
is included.
.Pp
.El
The following variables that control how things are made/installed that
are not set by default. These should not be set by Makefiles; they're for
the user to define in
.Sy MAKECONF
(see \*[Lt]bsd.own.mk\*[Gt], below) or on the
.Xr make 1
command line:
.Bl -tag -width CXXFLAGS.lib\*[Lt]lib\*[Gt]
.It Sy BSDOBJDIR
The real path to the
.Sq obj
tree for the
.Nx
source tree.
.DFLT
.Pa /usr/obj
.
.It Sy BSDSRCDIR
The real path to the
.Nx
source tree.
.DFLT
.Pa /usr/src
.
.It Sy BUILD
If defined,
.Sq "make install"
checks that the targets in the source directories are up-to-date and
re-makes them if they are out of date, instead of blindly trying to install
out of date or non-existent targets.
.DFLTu
.
.It Sy BUILDID
Identifier for the build.
The identifier will be appended to
object directory names, and can be consulted in the
.Xr make 1
configuration file in order to set additional build parameters,
such as compiler flags.
.DFLTu
.
.It Sy COPTS
Extra options for the C compiler.
Should be appended to (e.g.,
.Sy COPTS+=-g ) ,
rather than explicitly set.
.
.It Sy DESTDIR
Directory to contain the built
.Nx
system.
If set, special options are passed to the compilation tools to
prevent their default use of the host system's
.Sy /usr/include , /usr/lib ,
and so forth.
This pathname should
.Em not
end with a slash
.Pq /
character (for installation into the system's root directory, set
.Sy DESTDIR
to an empty string).
The directory must reside on a file system which supports long file
names and hard links.
.DFLT
Empty string if
.Sy USETOOLS
is
.Dq yes ;
unset otherwise.
.Pp
.Em Note :
.Sy build.sh
will provide a default of
.Pa destdir. Ns Sy MACHINE
(in the top-level
.Sy .OBJDIR )
unless run in
.Sq expert
mode
.
.It Sy MAKEVERBOSE
Control how "verbose" the standard make(1) rules are.
Default: 2, supported values:
.Bl -tag -width M
.It Dv 0
Minimal output
.Pq Dq quiet
.It Dv 1
Describe what is occurring
.It Dv 2
Describe what is occurring and echo the actual command
.El
.Pp
.It Sy MKBFD

.Sy libbfd ,
.Sy libiberty ,

upon them (such as the binutils,
.Xr as 1 ,

or
.Xr mdsetimage 8 )
should be built.

even when building native tool components.
This is similar to the traditional

verify that the compilation tools in use are up-to-date enough in order
to build the tree successfully.
This may cause build or runtime problems when building the whole

.Sy USE_KERBEROS 
will also be forced to
.Dq no .
.
.It Sy USE_PAM
.YorN
If
.Sq no ,
disables building PAM authentication support into various system
utilities/libraries that support it.
If
.Sy ${MKPAM}
is

.Sy USE_PAM
will also be forced to
.Dq no .
.
.It Sy USE_SKEY
.YorN
If
.Sq no ,
disables building S/key authentication support into various system
utilities/libraries that support it.

.YorN
If
.Sq no ,
disables building YP (NIS) support into various system utilities/libraries
that support it.
If
.Sy ${MKYP}
is
.Dq no ,

will also be forced to
.Dq no .

.It Sy CXXFLAGS.\*[Lt]prog\*[Gt]
These provide a way to specify additions to the associated
variables in a way that applies only to a particular library
or program. 
\*[Lt]lib\*[Gt] corresponds to the
.Sy LIB
variable set in
the library's
.Pa Makefile . 
\*[Lt]prog\*[Gt] corresponds to either
.Sy PROG
or
.Sy PROG_CXX
(if set). 
For example, if
.Sy COPTS.libcrypto
is set to
.Dq -g ,
.Dq -g
will be added to
.Sy COPTS
only when compiling the crypto library.
