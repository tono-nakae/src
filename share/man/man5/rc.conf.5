.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf
.Nd system startup configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file specifies which services are enabled during system startup by
the startup script
.Pa /etc/rc .
The
.Nm
file is a shell script that is sourced by
.Pa /etc/rc
if it exists, meaning
that
.Nm
must contain valid shell commands.
.Pp
Listed below are the
.Nm
variables that may be set, the values that each may be set to,
a brief description of what each variable does, and a reference to
relevant manual pages. Most 
variables have three values: a list of parameters to pass on the
command line, "DEFAULT" for a reasonable default set of parameters,
or "NO" if the daemon is not to be run at all. Some programs don't
take a set of flags, and may only be set to "YES" or "NO". A few are
always run, and will not take "NO."
The arguments passed if "DEFAULT" is chosen are listed in
.Nm
itself.
.Pp
Actions to perform on boot-up:
.Bl -tag -width bootparamd_flags
.It Sy update_motd
YES or NO.  Updates the
.Nx
version string in the
.Pa /etc/motd
file to reflect the version of the running kernel.  See
.Xr motd 5 .
.El
.Pp
Programs run on boot-up:
.Bl -tag -width bootparamd_flags
.It Sy savecore_flags
Parameters, DEFAULT or NO.
Saves a copy of the kernel and crash dump when the system comes up
after a crash.  The
.Ar -z
parameter will compress the kernel and crash dump.  See
.Xr savecore 8 .
.It Sy lkm_init
YES or NO. Loads
.Xr lkm 4
modules based on information in
.Pa /etc/lkm.conf .
See
.Xr lkm.conf 5 .
.It Sy ipfilter
YES or NO.  Runs 
.Xr ipf 8
to load in packet filter specifications from
.Pa /etc/ipf.conf
at network boot time, before any interfaces are configured.  See
.Xr ipf 5 .
.It Sy ntpdate_hosts
Parameters, DEFAULT or NO.
List of time servers for
.Xr ntpdate 8 .
If DEFAULT, the list of servers is loaded from
.Pa /etc/ntp.conf .
.El
.Pp
Interface boot-up configuration:
.Bl -tag -width bootparamd_flags
.It Sy net_interfaces
Parameters, DEFAULT, or NO.
Lists a set of interfaces to be configured with
.Xr ifconfig 8
at boot time.
If DEFAULT, the interfaces are found by running
.Xr ifconfig 8
with the
.Fl l
flag. Usually, the parameters for the subsequent
.Xr ifconfig 8
commands are found in files named
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.* ,
where
.Dq *
is the name of each interface (e.g.
.Pa /etc/ifconfig.le0 ) .
Alternatively, the parameters may be taken from an
.Sy ifconfig_*
variable (see below).  In either case, the parameters have the interface
name prepended to them and are then handed to
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.It Sy ifconfig_*
Parameters only.
Supplies a set of parameters for configuring the given interface
.Dq *
(e.g.
.Sy ifconfig_le0 ) .
See
.Sy net_interfaces
above.
.El
.Pp

.Bl -tag -width bootparamd_flags
.It Sy inetd_flags
