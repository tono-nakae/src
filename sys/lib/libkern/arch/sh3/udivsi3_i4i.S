/*
 * XXX: uwe: this is a kludge...
 *
 * For unsigned integer division gcc used to emit a call to __udivsi3
 * "millicode" function that uses compiler-private ABI.  Newer gcc
 * uses heavily tuned __udivsi3_i4i that is NOT compatible with
 * __udivsi3 because it's expected to clobber different registers.  We
 * don't want to link the kernel against libgcc and we don't have
 * resources to write heavily tuned version ourselves, so clone
 * __udivsi3 but adjust it to conform to the __udivsi3_i4i clobber
 * spec.
 */

/*
 * IMPOTANT: This function is special.
 *
 * This function is an auxiliary function that is referenced by the
 * code generated by gcc for integer division.  But gcc does NOT treat
 * a call to this function as an ordinary function call w.r.t. the set
 * of register this call clobbers.  See the definition of "udivsi3_i1"
 * in gcc/config/sh/sh.md.
 *
 * Any call to this function MUST NOT clobber any registers besides r4
 * and r0, where the result is returned.  At the time of the call the
 * r4 contains the first argument, so we are only left with r0, and we
 * cannot do anything meaningful using only one register.  The
 * consequences are:
 *
 * . this function cannot have _PROF_PROLOGUE
 * . this function cannot be called via PLT
