Ok this is the current todo list.

There are a number of things that need to be done that I do not
have time to do and am unlikely to have time to do them in the near
future. These are currently being left in the hope that users will do them
instead.

1.  replace netinet/in_cksum.c with an assembly version
2.  replace netns/ns_chsum.c with an assembly version
3.  drivers for currently unsupported podules
4.  replacing the C string functions in libc with assembly ones (work
    started but not finished)
5.  porting libpthread to arm32 architecture
6.  the ARM FPE postproc handler should check need_resched and CURSIG()
    in the assembly glue and only switch to SVC and do a userret() if
    required.
7.  L1 page tables should be freed when a process is swapped out and
    reallocated when the process is swapped in.
8.  bcopy() needs optimising.
9.  cleanup video DRAM support on machine with VRAM
10. clean up prototype declarations
11. support reading and writing the rtc device
12. debug kernel profiling
13. debug / replace console code
14. fix FPA probing
15. optimise ARM FPE glue code
16. modify wd.c to avoid using the softc in the probe function
17. fix mainbus configuration code
18. optimise irq delivery code
19. improve fiq handling code
20. Debug kernel linking with the NetBSD linker
21. Complete hydra support
22. Debug GCC/arm
23. PIC support in GCC/arm
24. Shared libraries
25. Remove debug.c
26. Remove stubs.c
27. Remove kshell/*
28. Remove postmortem.c
29. Debug audio drivers
30. Merge in lmcaudio driver for the RC7500
31. 16 bit sound driver
32. Create generic SEEQ8004/8005 driver
33. Create ea and eb front ends for the generic SEEQ driver
34. Replace EtherH driver with new version
35. Merge in Ether2 driver
36. Add support for the StrongARM
37. Add support for ARM8 cores and the ARM810
38. Add 4bbp and LCD support to the console driver
39. Port GDB.
