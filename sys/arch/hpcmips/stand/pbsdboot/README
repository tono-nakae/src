0. What is this? 

  This program load the NetBSD/hpcmips kernel and execute it.

  - All data on your PDA will be lost if the kernel boot successfully.
  - NetBSD/hpcmips kernel is ELF format binary executable.
  - This program supports only MIPS (especially NEC VR41X1 or VR4102 CPU)
    platforms -- NEC MC-R series, CASIO E- series, Everex Freestyle and 
    others.

1. How to use

  - Copy pbsdboot.exe and the kernel 'netbsd into your PDA and start
    pbsdboot.exe.
  - Select 'kernel name' and 'Frame buffer' appropriately.
  - Push [boot] button.

2. How to compile

  Use Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 and Windows CE toolkit for VC++ 5.0. It also
  needs Embedded toolkit for accessing raw block device to support native
  file system, FFS.

  VC++ 6.0 and toolkit 6.0 may works. But I've never tried.
