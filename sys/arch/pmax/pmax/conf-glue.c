/*
 * conf-glue.c:
 * A hand-edited ioconf.c, as generated by config.old program
 *
 * Seriously munged  to support old-stype pmax configurations
 * configured and compiled with new config.
 * Since new config doesn't yet support most pmax drivers,
 * this file contains an driver configuration table produced
 * by config.old run on a `generic' configuration.
 * This table uses device counts produced by the new config
 * ``needs-count'' keyword, that tells us at compile time
 * the maximum number of each device  that were configured.
 *
 * It also  provides a dummy set of cfdriver  structures,
 * for devices present in the configuration file, but
 * whose drivers don't (yet) have a struct cfdriver.
 * This avoids link-time errors with unresolved references
 * from the `parent table' produced by new-style config,
 * which assumes all device drivers have a struct cfdriver.
 *
 * THIS MAY NOT WORK FOR ALL MACHINES.
