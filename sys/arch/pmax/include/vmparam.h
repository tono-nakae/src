 * VM_PHYSSEG_MAX
 *   We have two freelists. The first 8M of RAM goes onto a lower-priority
 *   free list, since some TC boards (e.g. PixelStamp boards) are only able 
 *   to DMA into this region, and we want them to have a fighting chance of
 *   allocating their DMA memory during autoconfiguration.
 *
 * VM_PHYSSEG_NOADD
 *   We can't add RAM after vm_mem_init.
