/*
 * Emulation of VAX REI instruction.
 *
 * This code deals with checking for and servicing ASTs
 * (profiling, scheduling) and software interrupts (network, softclock).
 * We check for ASTs first, just like the VAX.  To avoid excess overhead
 * the T_ASTFLT handling code will also check for software interrupts so we
 * do not have to do it here.
 *
 * This code is complicated by the fact that sendsig may have been called
 * necessitating a stack cleanup.  A cleanup should only be needed at this
 * point for coprocessor mid-instruction frames (type 9), but we also test
 * for bus error frames (type 10 and 11).
