#	partition the disk (disklabel)
#	install the miniroot in the swap partition

# Filesystem options
# May need NFS to get miniroot image
file-system	NFS		# nfs client support

# Note the flags on the esp entries below, that work around
# deficiencies in the old driver: (may not be needed anymore)
#	bits 0-7:  disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
#	bits 8-15: disable synch negotiation for target [bit-8]
#	Note: targets 4-7 have disconnect/reselect enabled on the premise
#	      that tape devices normally have one of these targets. Tape
#	      devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus
#	      to operate acceptably.
