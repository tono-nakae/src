						<$Revision: 1.6 $> 

This is to be a summary of the status of code, its problems,
and the directions it should and take in the future.

Summary: Execs SunOS /sbin/init.  executes system calls but when it forks, the
		new process segfaults immediately.  still some bug in
		softclock() processing.  All this via nfs_diskless since
		there is no scsi driver.

For bugs list, and missing functionality, see "TODO".
