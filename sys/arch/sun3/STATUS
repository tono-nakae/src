						<$Revision: 1.7 $> 

This is to be a summary of the status of code, its problems,
and the directions it should and take in the future.

Summary: Execs SunOS /sbin/init.  executes system calls but when it forks, the
	 new process segfaults immediately.  Possibly some bug in
	 softclock() processing, as scheduling may be muffed.
	 All this via nfs_diskless since there is no scsi driver.

	 nfs_diskless structure is hardwired :)

For bugs list, and missing functionality, see "TODO".
