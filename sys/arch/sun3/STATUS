						<$Revision: 1.8 $> 

This is to be a summary of the status of code, its problems,
and the direction it should take in the future.

Summary: Boots via nfsdiskless (due to lack of a scsi driver),
	 execs /sbin/init (MID_M68K), and because single-user is forced,
	 provides a /bin/sh.  It works, though the console driver is flakey
	 and there are a bunch of vm/pmap assertions that should be
	 investigated

	 nfs_diskless structure is hardwired :)

For bugs list, and missing functionality, see "TODO".
