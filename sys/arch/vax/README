Some information and status of VAX port:

It now runs multi-user on 11/750 without problem, but still requires
4.3BSD Reno binaries (nothing in userspace fixed yet). Hopefully
most bugs in memory and trap handling are found, I haven't had a
crash for nearly a month... 
Note: VAX port is still for unix hackers only.

Devices supported in kernel and _known_ to work:
VAX 11/750 CPU with 2-14MB of memory.
One or more DEUNA/DELUA Ethernet cards.
One or more UDA50 MSCP disk controllers.
RA81, RA82 or RA90 disks on UDA50.

Things _not_ written in kernel yet:
User level profiling & debugging support.
Kernel profiling.
sysctl() calls.
Kernel debugger support, DDB (But that is not so important).
Autoconfiguration of Unibus devices is working, but it's a mess
internally. I will clean this up someday when I get docs on UDA50/MSCP.

/boot program is written, but it only supports Massbuss disks
so far. UDA routines will be written soon, boot blocks also.

I have only included relevant files from old berkeley VAX distributions.
If you want to look at other files get them from nearest ftp site with
an 4.4BSD distribution, or from ftp.luth.se:/pub/unix/4_4bsd_l directory.

We who have done parts of this is:
	Joachim Isaksson, first pmap and lots of help with gcc functionality.
	Mattias Gr|nlund, locore assembler and interrupt handling.
	Mattias ]slund, lots of help and ideas everywhere.
	Anders Magnusson, that's me, who put things together and wrote the rest.
