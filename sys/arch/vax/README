Some information and status of VAX port:

It now runs multi-user on 11/750 with not to much problem.
There are still lots of bugs, and some unimplemented things.
Things that needs to be done:

- Repair pmap, something maps wrong sometimes.
- Fix doublemapping of kernel stack in user space.
- Set right security permissions of everything (Usch!)
- Setup autoconfiguring, and make it work.
- Write boot stuff.
- Fix DELUA support (currently broken). Probably easy.

Currently supported hardware:
VAX 11/750 with at least 3MB memory.
UDA50 (or compatible) disc controller.
MSCP-device for UDA50 (RA81 or something).

We are developing on 11/750's with Massbuss disks, because of the ease to share
disks between computers, but have root filesystem on an RA81 on an UDA50.
In the future we have the possibility to try it out on almost all VAX cpu
types, ka730, ka780, ka420, ka630, ka650, ka8200, ka8600 and ka8800. Phew :)

I have only included relevant files from old berkeley VAX distributions.
If you want to look at other files get them from nearest ftp site with
an 4.4BSD distribution, or from ftp.luth.se:/pub/unix/4_4bsd_l directory.
