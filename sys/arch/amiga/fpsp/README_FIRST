I got the FPSP source from the Motorola BBS and have converted it
to GNU GAS format.

The three subdirectories are:
	src_asm	FPSP source from the Motorola BBS.
	src_as	FPSP source from the Motorola BBS.
	src_gas	FPSP source in GNU GAS format.  I did this by
		running some `flex' lexical analyzers on the
		src_asm files.  

A big thanks goes out to Michael Hitch (osymh@gemini.oscs.montana.edu) for
solving the problem I had with some operations locking up.  The problem
was that there were some branch instructions in gen_except.s that
were `word' when they should have been `long'.

I had to make a little tweak to gas version 2.1.1 to get it to assemble.
Around line 2190 of tc-m68k.c you have to change a `#if 0' to `#if 1':
=============================================================================
	      /* We gotta put out some float */
#if 1
	      if (seg (opP->con1) != SEG_BIG)
		{
		  int_to_gen (nextword);
		  gen_to_words (words, baseo, (long int) outro);
		  for (wordp = words; baseo--; wordp++)
		    addword (*wordp);
		  break;
		}		/* Its BIG */
#else
	      if (seg (opP->con1) != big_section)
		{
		  abort ();
		}
#endif
