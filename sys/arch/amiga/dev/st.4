.Sh NAME
.Nm \&st
.Nd
.Tn CCS SCSI
tape driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tape st0 at scsi? slave ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm \&st
driver was written especially to support the Exabyte
.Tn EXB-8200 8MM
Cartridge 
Tape Subsystem.  It has several extensions specific to the Exabyte,
but should support other tape drives as long as they follow
the
.Tn ANSI SCSI-I
specification.  Besides extensive use with
an Exabyte 8200, the driver has been tested with an
Archive
.Tn QIC-24
tape drive, an Archive
.Tn Viper QIC-150
, an Archive
.Tn Viper 2525,
an Archive
.Tn Python 27216 and 25501,
a Caliper
.Tn CP150,
a HP35450A,
a Wangtek 
.Tn 5150ES,
a Wangtek 5099ES,
and a Wangtek 5150ES, which is also currently the default drive type.
The
.Nm \&st
tape interface provides a standard tape drive interface 
as described in
.Xr mtio 4
with the following exceptions:
.Bl -enum
.It
Density is dependent on device type.  Current Exabyte hardware has
only one density. The
.Tn EXB-8500
drive, when released, will have a high
density format of
.Tn 5.6GB .
On an Archive
.Tn QIC-24
drive the driver reads both
.Tn QIC-11
and
.Tn QIC-24
formats
but writes only
.Tn QIC-24. On an Archive
.Tn Viper QIC-150
drive the driver reads and writes only
.Tn QIC-150
formats, it should also be able to read
.Tn QIC-11
and
.Tn QIC-24
but this has not been verified.
On an Archive
.Tn Viper 2525
the drive can read and write
.Tn QIC-525, QIC-150, QIC-120
and can also read
.Tn QIC-24
tapes.
.It
Only the ``raw'' interface is supported.
.El
.Pp
Special Exabyte Support:
.Pp
The
.Dv MTIOCGET
.Xr ioctl 2
call on an Exabyte returns this structure:
.Bd -literal
struct mtget {
	short	mt_type;	/* type of magtape device */
        /* the following two registers are grossly device dependent */
	short	mt_dsreg;	/* sc_flags,  ``drive status'' register */
	short	mt_erreg;	/* high 8 bytes error status, ``error'' register */
	/* low  8 bytes percentage of Rewrites
	if writing, ECC errors if reading */
        /* end device-dependent registers */
	short	mt_resid;	/*  Mbyte until end of tape ,residual count */
        /* the following two are not yet implemented */
	daddr_t	mt_fileno;	/* file number of current position */
	daddr_t	mt_blkno;	/* block number of current position */
        /* end not yet implemented */
};


.Ed
.Pp
Bits 3 and 4 in the minor device are used to select tape density.
Often when these bits are zero, as in the case of the Archive
.Tn Viper 2525,
the drive will automatically determine the tape type and
format when reading. When writing should these bits be zero, the drive
will write the highest valid density for a given tape type. For the Archive
.Tn Viper 2525
using unit 0 with density = 0x01, which is /dev/rst8 assumes the tape is a QIC-24,
density = 0x10 which is /dev/rst16 assumes the tape is a QIC-120,
density = 0x11 which is /dev/rst24 assumes the tape is a QIC-150,
density = 0x00 which is /dev/rst0 will allow the use of a QIC-525 with a 6525 tape.
This density mapping will vary depending on the drive
type.

Bit 5 in the minor device number is used
to select long filemarks or short filemarks. A long filemark occupies
2.12 MBytes of space on the tape, while a short filemark occupies 488 KBytes.
A long filemark includes an erase gap while the short filemark does not.
The tape can be positioned on the
.Tn BOT
side of a long filemark allowing
data to be appended with a write operation.  Since the short filemark does not
contain an erase gap which would allow writing it is considered to be
non-erasable.  If either type of filemark is followed by blank tape,
data may be appended on its
.Tn EOT
side.
.Pp
Bit 6 in the minor device number selects fixed block mode with a block
size of 1K.  Variable length records are the default if bit 6 is not
set.
.Pp
For unit 0 here are the effects of minor device bits 2,3,4,5,6. For other
units add the
.Em unit#
to each of the device names.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm \&st
driver was derived from the hp300 st.c tape driver in June of 1993.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Tn HP
98268
.Tn SCSI
controller hardware can not do odd length
.Tn DMA
transfers.  If odd length
.Tn DMA I/O
is requested the driver will use the
"Program Transfer Mode" of the Fujitsu
.Tn MB87030
chip. Read requests are
normally even length for which a
.Tn DMA
transfer is used. If, however, the
driver detects that a odd length read has happened (when a even length
was requested) it will issue the
.Dv EIO
error and the last byte of the read
data will be 0x00. Odd length read requests must match the size of the
requested data block on tape.
.Pp
The following only applies when using long filemarks. Short filemarks can
not be overwritten.
.Bd -filled -offset 4n
Due to the helical scan and the erase mechanism, there is a writing
limitation on Exabyte drives.
.Dq Li tar r
or
.Dq Li tar u
will not work
.Pf ( Dq Li tar c
is ok).  One can only start writing at  1) beginning of tape, 2) on the
end of what was last written, 3) "front" side of a regular (long) filemark.
Say you have a tape with 3 tar files on it, want to save the first
file, and want to begin writing over the 2nd file.
.Pp
On a normal 1/4" or 1/2" drive you would do:
.Pp
.Li "mt fsf 1; tar cf /dev/nrst0 ..."
.Pp
but for an Exabyte you need to do:
.Pp
.Li "mt fsf 1; mt bsf 1; mt weof 1; tar cf /dev/nrst0 ..."
.Pp
The regular long filemark consists of an erased zone 3.8" long
(needed to begin a write).  In this case, the first filemark is
rewritten in place, which creates an erased zone
.Em after
it, clearing the
way to write more on the tape.  The erase head is not helical.
.Pp
One can position a tape to the end of what was last written by reading
until a
.Tn \*qBLANK CHECK\*q
error is returned.  Writing can be started at this
point.  (This applies to both long and short filemarks.)  The tape does
not become positioned somewhere down the "erased" area as does a
conventional magtape.  One can issue multiple reads at the
.Tn \*qBLANK CHECK\*q
error, but the Exabyte stays positioned at the beginning of the
blank area, ready to accept write commands.  File skip operations do
not stop at blank tape and will run into old data or run to the end of
the tape, so you have to be careful not to
.Dq Li mt fsf too_many .
.Ed
.Pp
Archive support gets confused if asked to moved more filemarks than there are
on the tape.
.Pp
This man page needs some work.  Some of these are not really bugs,
just unavoidable consequences of the hardware.
.Pp
Amiga specific controller comments should be added and HP specific comments removed after we determine any SCSI controller specific problems.
