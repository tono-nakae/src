Alpha port status:

I've got it up and running and self-hosting on a 3000/400 -- any of the
3000 series _except the 3000/300 should work, too.  No frame buffer support,
and the serial driver support sucks, so the general strategy i use is
boot with a serial console, go multi-user, then log in over the network.

Complete support is _NOT_ yet in the source tree, and some of it (toolchain
support, etc.) won't ever be.  I'm going to be making a distribution of
sources and binaries in the next few days, and will announce its availability
when it's ready.

if you're interested in this code, you should subscribe to the NetBSD
'port-alpha' mailing list.
