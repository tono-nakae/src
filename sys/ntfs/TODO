NTFS - list of things to do in no particular order:

- handle Unicode chars more inteligently - currently only iso-8859-1
  chars are supported, it should be possible to get the filename
  converted into koi-8, iso-8859-2 & utf-8 at least - there is
  some Unicode support present under FreeBSD, would be worth considering
  for adoption (it's needed to properly support Juliet CDs anyway)

  * not very hard

- better support for writing; tricky is crash recovery

- cleanup the mess with several *readattr*() functions if possible

- ntfs_ntvattrget(): find out if it's worth the efford to use some hashing
  for the list of ntnodes, so that it's not all scanned each time; it would
  be fine to migrate the found ntnode towards the start of the list too;
  the list search code is duplicated on two places, eliminate the duplicity
  somehow
  
- convert the code to do caching in buffer cache indexed by
  file-vnode/file-offset so that NTFS would take advantage of UBC;
  it should also improve performance somewhat, because if it's necessary
  to find some offset in a file, it's possible to check if the data
  are available in the cache before doing the bmap operation first

- working VOP_BALLOC()

- add pathconf(2) support

- make ntfs nfs exportable, for the completeness sake
