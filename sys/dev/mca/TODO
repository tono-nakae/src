Bugs:
* i386: detect the existence of MCA bus by BIOS call
* i386: make isa/clock.c parse PS/2 CMOS correctly
* i386: keyboard freezes when booting from floppy in fd_mountroothook
	(timing issue ? works OK if I break to ddb before the mountroot hook
	is executed)

Projects:
* bus_dma(9) support (primarily for AHA-1640 ATM)
* 3Com 3c507 driver (prolly port of ef driver - originally, 1.3 ie driver
	has been ported in MCA release 2.1 by Scott Telford, the ISA
	attachment was then (after 1.3) split into ex, ef, ai)
* ESDI support
