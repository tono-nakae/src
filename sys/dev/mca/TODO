Bugs:
* i386: detect the existence of MCA bus by BIOS call
* i386: make isa/clock.c parse PS/2 CMOS correctly
* i386: keyboard freezes in fd_mountroothook when booting from floppy;
	if the fd_mountroothook is not executed, the keyboard works
	just fine

Projects:
* bus_dma(9) support (primarily for AHA-1640 ATM)
* 3Com 3c523 driver - linux 3c523.c driver is good as a help
* ESDI support
