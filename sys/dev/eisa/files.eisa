# Config.new file and device description for machine-independent EISA code.
# Included by ports that need it.  Requires that the SCSI files be
# defined first.

# XXX IN A PERFECT WORLD:
# ports should define their own "device eisa" line (like the one below,
# but with the correct bus attachment).

# XXX there should be MI EISA configuration, but not yet.
#device	eisa at root {[slot = -1]}
#file	dev/eisa/eisa.c			eisa

device	ahb at isa: scsi		# XXX should be at EISA
file	dev/eisa/aha1742.c	ahb
