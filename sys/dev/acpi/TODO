Important things to make ACPI useful on more machines:

* Add support for attaching acpiec devices early using the ECDT.  Some
  systems need this because otherwise their _INI methods try to access
  regions in the EC space before it's initialized.

* Fix the locking protocol in acpiec.

* Support thermal levels and fan control in acpitz.

* Deal with the "implicit" return problem for older laptops.
