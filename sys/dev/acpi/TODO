Important things to make ACPI useful on more machines:

* Fix problems with ACPI_PCI_FIXUP.  CardBus slots do not work in some
  machines currently.  (Affects many machines.)

* Deal with the "implicit return" problem for older laptops.  (Mostly
  affects older Toshiba laptops, like the Portege 7140.)
