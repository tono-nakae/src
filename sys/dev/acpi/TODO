Important things to make ACPI useful on more machines:

* Split the Region initialization into two passes -- one that fills in
  AddressSpace pointers, and one that calls _REG methods.  Right now we
  can lose due to a _REG method for one Region calling a method that
  accesses another Region that hasn't been fixed up yet.  (Affects
  Sverre Froyen's HP Omnibook 6000.)

* Fix problems with ACPI_PCI_FIXUP.  CardBus slots do not work in some
  machines currently.  (Affects many machines.)

* Add support for attaching acpiec devices early using the ECDT.  Some
  systems need this because otherwise their _INI methods try to access
  regions in the EC space before it's initialized.  (Affects Steve
  Rumble's Thinkpad T23.)

* Deal with the "implicit return" problem for older laptops.  (Mostly
  affects older Toshiba laptops, like the Portege 7140.)

* Support thermal levels and fan control in acpitz.
