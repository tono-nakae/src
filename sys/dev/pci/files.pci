# Config.new file and device description for machine-independent PCI code.
# Included by ports that need it.  Requires that the SCSI files be
# defined first.

# ports should define their own "device pci" line (like the one below,
# but with the correct bus attachment).

#device	pci at mainbus {[bus = -1], [dev = -1]}
file	dev/pci/pci_subr.c		pci needs-flag

# Ethernet driver for DC21040-based boards
device	de at pci: ether, ifnet
file	dev/pci/if_de.c			de

# Digital DEFPA PCI FDDI Controller
device	fpa at pci: pdq, fddi, ifnet
file	dev/pci/if_fpa.c		fpa

# NCR 53c8xx SCSI chips
device	ncr at pci: scsi
file	dev/pci/ncr.c			ncr
