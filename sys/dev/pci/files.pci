# Config.new file and device description for machine-independent PCI code.
# Included by ports that need it.  Requires that the SCSI files be
# defined first.

# ports should define their own "device pci" line (like the one below,
# but with the correct bus attachment).

#device	pci at root {[bus = -1], [dev = -1]}
file	dev/pci/pci.c			pci

# NCR 53C8{10,15,25} SCSI chips
device	ncr at pci: scsi
file	dev/pci/ncr.c			ncr

# XXX ???
# XXX NOT IN TREE?
#device	de at pci: ether, ifnet
#file	dev/pci/if_de.c			de
