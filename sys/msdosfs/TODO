- use the dirty flag Win95 OSR2 introduced, as noted in bin/5638
- the fat cache (see msdosfs_fat.c, denode->de_fc[]) should prolly
	hold _all_ clusters for directories - should speed up repetitive
	scanning through whole directory when extracting an archive
	into msdosfs filesystem (e.g. tar does unlink followed by create
	and both these functions need to scan whole directory to check
	if the file is or isn't there)
	- doing something similar for files is probably not worth the
	  efford, because the files are scanned much less frequently
	  and might be big
