	$NetBSD: TODO,v 1.6 2009/03/29 14:56:00 pooka Exp $

* fix the build structure to work better on non-NetBSD
* figure out how to handle mount parameters in fs-independent
  fashion (requires kernel changes)
* integrate build framework with config(1) to stop the need to
  maintain a separate build infrastructure
* find a better solution for rumpdefs.h, the sed "solution"
  doesn't really scale nicely
* add a "proper" scheduler, i.e. map threads to virtual cpu's
  + need to introduce a guard at all entry points into rumpspace
