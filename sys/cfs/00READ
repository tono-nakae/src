NOTE:	Please do not edit any files in this directory
	until this NOTE is removed.
	In the next week, I want to clear out all the 
	platform and release #ifdefs from the code.

NOTE:	The matching user level code has not been released
	yet.  It will be available soon.  The existing released
	Coda code is not quite ready for current.  We'll
	have some patches out soon.

NOTE:	There are a few patches that need to be applied to sys
	for these changes to work today.  They'll be integrated
	in soon.

WARNING:A version of this code has run on 1.3 for a while now.
	The code has been recently ported to current.  It is mostly
	working, but hasn't been run long enough to be sure all the
	bugs are sorted out.  Let me know if there are any problems.
	In particular, killing venus (or rebooting) when/if venus
	is hung, may not work correctly.

	This code is not SMP ready.  Most locks are on vnodes
	and cnodes and go thru the lock manager.  There are a
	few hashes and queues that need to be locked -- I think that's
	all that is needed.
