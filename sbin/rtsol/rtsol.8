.Sh NAME
.Nm rtsol
.Nd send router solicitation
.\"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl nv
.Ar interface
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Rtsol
sends router solicitation packet to the specified
.Ar interface .
If there is any router on the network, the router may respond by
router advertisement packet.
Router advertisement packet contains information about the network,
the link-local address of the router, and so forth.
The kernel will install the new routing information and address prefix
for the
.Ar interface ,
according to the information.
.Pp
.Nm
implements some quickhack code for notebook computers.
.Fl n
disables the behavior
.Pq the flag stands for no tricks .
.Pp
If
.Fl v 
is specified,
.Nm
will generate more messages.
This is mostly for debugging.
.Pp
Router advertisement packet will be processed only if the
node is configured as a host, not a router.
To accept router advertisement packet,
.Xr sysctl 8
variables must be set as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset
# sysctl -w net.inet6.ip6.forwarding=0
# sysctl -w net.inet6.ip6.accept_rtadv=1
.Ed
.Pp
Typically this is done in system startup scripts, such as
.Xr rc 8 .
.\"
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The program exits with 0 on success, non-zero on failures.

command first appeared in WIDE Hydrangea IPv6 protocol stack kit.
