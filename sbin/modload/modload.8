.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility loads a kernel module specified by the
.Ar module
paramamter into the running system.
.Pp
The current working directory is first searched for the module object file.
If not found there, the default system module areas are searched.

are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xbxvarxbooleanx
.It Fl b Ar var=boolean
Pass the module a boolean property with the name
.Ar var .
.Ar boolean
may be either
.Dv true
or
.Dv false .

When a module is loaded, the kernel checks if the module is compatible
with the running kernel and will refuse to load modules that are
potentially incompatible.
This option disables compatibility checks.
.Em Note :
an incompatible module can cause system instability, including data
loss or corruption.
.It Fl i Ar var=integer
Pass the module an integer property with the name
.Ar var
and integral value
.Ar integer .
.It Fl m Ar plist
When used in conjuction with
.Fl p
merge new options with an existing property list contained in
.Ar plist .
.It Fl p
Output a property list suitable for loading along with a module.
When using this option, you do not need to specify a module.
.It Fl s Ar var=string

.Ar var
and string value
