.Sh NAME
.Nm scan_ffs
.Nd finding FFSv1/FFSv2 partitions on a disk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl lv
.Op Fl s Ar start
.Op Fl e Ar end
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program will take a raw disk device that covers the whole disk,
and will find all possible FFSv1/FFSv2 partitions with different block
sizes on the disk.
It will show the filesystem type (FFSv1 or FFSv2), size and offset.
Also it has an option to show the values with a disklabel-alike
output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
This will make
.Nm
print out a string looking much like the input to disklabel.
With a little massaging, this output can usually be used in the disklabel edit.
.Pp
.It Fl v
Tell
.Nm
to be verbose about what it is doing, and what it has found.
.Pp
.It Fl s Ar start
Tell
.Nm
where to start searching for filesystems.
This makes it easier to skip swap
partitions, or other large non-UFS/FFS partitions.
.Pp
.It Fl e Ar end
Ditto for telling
.Nm
where to stop.
It will default to max sectors on the disk if it wasn't specified.
.Pp
.It Ar device
This specifies which device
.Nm
should use to scan for filesystems.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared in
.Ox 2.3
and then in
.Nx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.Nm
was written for
.Ox
by
.An Niklas Hallqvist
and
.An Tobias Weingartner .
It was ported to
.Nx
by
.An Juan Romero Pardines .
.Sh BUGS
Currently it won't find FFSv1 partitions with fragsize/blocksize
greater than 2048/16384, and FFSv2 partitions with fragsize/blocksize
greater than 8192/65536.
