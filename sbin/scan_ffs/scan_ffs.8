.Sh NAME
.Nm scan_ffs
.Nd find FFSv1/FFSv2 partitions on a disk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl lv
.Op Fl e Ar end
.Op Fl s Ar start
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
will take a raw disk device that covers the whole disk
and will find all possible FFSv1/FFSv2 partitions, independent of block
sizes, on the disk.
It will show the file system type (FFSv1 or FFSv2), size, and offset.
Also it has an option to show the values with a disklabel-alike
output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXsXstartXX
.It Fl e Ar end
Where to stop searching for file systems.
The
.Ar end
argument specifies the last sector that will be searched.
Default is the last sector of
.Ar device .
.It Fl l
Print out a string looking much like the input to disklabel.
With a little massaging, this output can usually be used by
.Xr disklabel 8 .
.It Fl s Ar start
Where to start searching for file systems.
This makes it easier to skip swap
partitions or other large non-UFS/FFS partitions.
The
.Ar start
argument specifies the first sector that will be searched.
Default is the first sector of
.Ar device .
.It Fl v
Be verbose about what
.Nm
is doing, and what has been found.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar device
argument specifies which device
.Nm
should scan for file systems.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared in
.Ox 2.3
and then in
.Nx 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
.Nm
was written for
.Ox
by
.An Niklas Hallqvist
and
.An Tobias Weingartner .
It was ported to
.Nx
by
.An Juan Romero Pardines .
.Sh BUGS
Currently
.Nm
won't find FFSv1 partitions with fragsize/blocksize greater than
2048/16384, and FFSv2 partitions with fragsize/blocksize greater
than 8192/65536.
