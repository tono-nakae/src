.Sh NAME
.Nm scan_lfs
.Nd finding LFS partitions on a disk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl lv
.Op Fl e Ar end
.Op Fl s Ar start
.Ar device
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program will take a raw disk device that covers the whole disk,
and will find all possible FFS/LFS partitions with different block
sizes on the disk.
It will show the file system type (FFSv[12] or LFS), size and offset.
Also it has an option to show the values with a disklabel-alike
output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXsXstartXX
.It Fl e Ar end
Where to stop searching for file systems.
The
.Ar end
argument specifies the last sector that will be searched.
Default is the last sector of
.Ar device .
.It Fl l
Print out a string looking much like the input to disklabel.
With a little massaging, this output can usually be used by
.Xr disklabel 8 .
.It Fl s Ar start
Where to start searching for file systems.
This makes it easier to skip swap
partitions, or other large non-UFS/FFS partitions.
The
.Ar start
argument specifies the first sector that will be searched.
Default is the first sector of
.Ar device .
.It Fl v
Be verbose about what
.Nm
is doing, and what has been found.
.El
.Pp
The
.Ar device
argument specifies which device
.Nm
should scan for file systems.
