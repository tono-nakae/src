bootstrapping procedures
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm reboot
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl s
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn NetBSD
kernel is started by placing it at the beginning of physical memory
and transferring to the entry point.
Since the system is not reenterable,
it is necessary to read it in from disk or tape
each time it is to be bootstrapped.
.Pp
.Sy Rebooting a running system .
When a
.Tn NetBSD
kernel is running and a reboot is desired,
.Xr shutdown 8
is normally used.
If there are no users then
.Nm reboot
can be used.
Reboot causes the disks to be synced and allows the system
to perform other shutdown activities such as resynchronizing
hardware time-of-day clocks.
A multi-user reboot (as described below) is then initiated.
This causes a system to be
booted and an automatic disk check to be performed.  If all this succeeds
without incident, the system is then brought up for many users.
.Pp
Options to reboot are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.\" .It Fl d
.\" option forces a memory dump to the swap area (see
.\" .Xr crash 8 )
.\" before rebooting.
.\" This can be used if the system is in a funny state that you would
.\" like to ``snapshot'' and analyze later.
.It Fl n
option avoids the sync.  It can be used if a disk or the processor
is on fire. 
.It Fl q
reboots quickly and ungracefully, without shutting down running
processes first.
.\" .It Fl s
.\" option reboots to single user mode.
.El
.Pp
.Nm Reboot
normally logs the reboot using
.Xr syslog 8
and places a shutdown record in the login accounting file (see
.Xr utmp 5 .
These actions are inhibited if the
.Fl n
or
.Fl q
options are present.
.Pp
.Sy Power fail and crash recovery.
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Pp
.Sy Cold starts.
At power up, all DECstation ROMs consult the
.Nm haltaction
environment
variable in EEPROM to determine whether or not to autoboot.   If this
variable is set to 
.Fl h,
the ROM presents a prompt on the console.   If
set to
.Fl b,
the ROM attempts to autoboot.
.Pp
On the DECstation 2100 and 3100, the autoboot path is stored in the
.Nm bootpath
environment variable.   The path is made up of a 
device type specifier (e.g., rz, tz, mop or tftp) followed by
a triplet in the form (x, y, z), followed by a filename to load.
.Pp
X is the controller (always 0), y is the SCSI id of the drive to
boot from or 0 for net boots, and z is the partition to boot from
(usually 0 for SCSI devices, always zero for network booting.
Network boots may simply specify () since all three values are
always zero.
.Pp
The filename is optional for bootp/tftp and mop booting, since in
these cases the network protocol can be used to determine which
file to boot.  When booting off the tape, no filename should be
specified, and when booting off of disk, the filename of a kernel
must be specified.  Generally, the kernel is named
.Nm netbsd.
.Pp
For autoboots, the ROM automatically passes a
.Fl -a
argument to the boot
loader, indicating an autoboot.   If booting is invoked manually,
the
.Fl -a
argument is passed only when the
.Nm auto
command is used.
.Pp
On TurboChannel machines (all DECstation 5000 models), the boot path
is specified in the boot environment variable, along with any arguments
to be passed to the kernel.   Note that to specify boot arguments (e.g.,
.Fl -a
) when setting the
.Nm boot
environment variable, the filename and arguments
must be enclosed in quotes.   For example:
.nf
.sp 1
setenv boot "3/rz4/netbsd -a"
.fi
.Pp
The device from which to boot is specified as the TurboChannel slot
number, a TurboChannel-option-specific device name, and a path to the
file to load, all seperated by slashes.   You can get a list of the
devices installed in your TurboChannel slots (as well as any built-in
devices which appear as TurboChannel slots) by typing the
.Nm cnfg
command
at the boot prompt.   You can get more detailed information about a specific
TurboChannel option by typing
.Nm cnfg
followed by the slot number of that
option.
.Pp
For SCSI devices, the option-specific device identifier is either rz# for
disks or tz# for tapes, where # is the SCSI id of the device.   For network
devices, the option-specific protocol identifier is either mop or tftp.
Filename requirements are as for the DECstation 2100 and 3100.
