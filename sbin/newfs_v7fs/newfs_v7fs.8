.Sh NAME
.Nm newfs_v7fs
.Nd construct a new 7th Edition(V7) File System
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl FPvZ
.Op Fl B Ar byte-order
.Op Fl n Ar inodes
.Op Fl s Ar sectors
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
builds a 7th Edition(V7) file system on the specified
.Ar special .
If it is a device, the size information will be taken from the disk label and
before running
.Nm
the disk must be labeled using
.Xr disklabel 8 ;
the proper fstype is
.Dq Version 7 .
Otherwise, the size must be specified on the command line.
V7 filesystem's block size and sector size are 512 byte.
Disk address limits are 24 bit.
.Pp
The following arguments are supported:
.Bl -tag -width XBXbyteXorderXX
.It Fl B Ar byte-order
Specify the metadata byte order of the file system to be created.
Valid byte orders are
.Sq be ,
.Sq le ,
and
.Sq pdp .
If no byte order is specified, the file system is created in host
byte order.
.It Fl F
Create file system to a regular file (needs the
.Fl s
option).
.It Fl n Ar inodes
This specifies the number of inodes for the filesystem.
If the number of inodes exceeds 65536, it is reduced to 65536.
.It Fl P
Display a progress meter for the file system construction.
.It Fl s Ar sectors
Create file system with specified number of disk sectors.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
.It Fl Z
Fill file with zeroes instead of creating a sparse file.
