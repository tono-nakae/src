.Sh NAME
.Nm newfs_v7fs
.Nd construct a new 7th Edition(V7) File System
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl B Ar byte-order
.Op Fl FZvP
.Op Fl s Ar sectors
.Op Fl n Ar inodes
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
builds a 7th Edition(V7) file system on the specified special.
If it is a device, the size information will be taken from the disk label and
before running
.Nm
the disk must be labeled using
.Xr disklabel 8 ;
the proper fstype is
.Dq Version 7 .
Otherwise, the size must be specified on the command line.
V7 filesystem's block size and sector size are 512byte.
disk address limits are 24bit.
.Pp
The following arguments are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl P
Display a progress meter for the file system construct.
.It Fl v
verbose.
.It Fl F
Create file system to a regular file.(needs -s option)
.It Fl s Ar sectors
Create file system with specified number of disk sectors.
.It Fl Z
Fill file with zeroes instead of creating a sparse file.
.It Fl B Ar byte-order
Specify the metadata byte order of the file system to be created.
Valid byte orders are
.Sq be
and
.Sq le
and
.Sq pdp .
If no byte order is specified, the file system is created in host
byte order.
.It Fl n Ar inodes
This specifies the number of inodes for the filesystem.
If number of inodes exceeds 65536, contracted to 65536.
