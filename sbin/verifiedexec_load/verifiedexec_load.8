.Sh NAME
.Nm verifiedexec_load
.Nd load verified exec fingerprints
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar fingerprints
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command loads the in-kernel fingerprint table from the fingerprints
given in the
.Ar fingerprints
file.
Once loaded the kernel can then validate executed programs
or files against the loaded fingerprints and report when fingerprints
do not match.
.Pp
The
.Ar fingerprints
file contains lines of fields (separated by one or more whitespace
characters) of the form:
.Dl path	fingerprint	type	options
Where path is the full path to the executable and fingerprint is a
hexadecimal representation of the fingerprint for the executable.
Type is the type of fingerprint used, currently this may be either
md5 or sha1.
Other fingerprints may be available depending on kernel support.
Options are the associated options for the executable.
Currently there are two valid options:
.Bl -tag -width INDIRECT -compact
.It Pa INDIRECT
If this option is set then the executable cannot be invoked directly, it
can only be used as an interpreter in shell scripts.
.It Pa FILE
Indicates that the fingerprint is associated with a file, not an
executable.
Files have their fingerprints verified during
.Xr open 2
and are automatically made read only.
.El
There must be only one executable/fingerprint pair per line.
Comments are indicated by the first character of a line being a
.Sq \&#
character.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/verifiedexec -compact
.It Pa /dev/verifiedexec
verified executable device node
.El
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 1.7 .
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
requires the kernel to have been configured with the
.Dv VERIFIED_EXEC
option and the verifiedexec pseudo-device.
